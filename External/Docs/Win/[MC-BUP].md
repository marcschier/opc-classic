## 1 Introduction

This document is a specification for the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) Upload
Protocol. This protocol is used to transfer large payloads from a client to a server or server to client
over networks with frequent disconnections and to send notifications from the server to a server
application about the availability of uploaded payloads. This protocol is layered on top of HTTP 1.1
and uses several standard HTTP headers and defines some new headers.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

### 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

back-end client: A component of this protocol that sends the notifications to the server

application.

BITS session: An entity collection of data on the server that maintains the state of a single

instance of a BITS upload. More details about the session state and actions can be found in
section 3.2.1.4.

BITS session ID: A GUID that identifies the BITS session on the server. See section 2.2.1.2 for

more details.

BITS-Host-ID: An optional secondary server address. See section 2.2.3.2 for more information.

destination URL: The location to which the request entity is being uploaded. For more

information, see [RFC1738].

entity: The payload of a transfer (by analogy to the definition in [RFC2616]).

globally unique identifier (GUID): A term used interchangeably with universally unique

identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of
these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value.
Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in
[RFC4122] or [C706] have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique
identifier (UUID).

origin server: The URL host name in the destination URL or an IPv6address (as specified in

[RFC2373] Appendix B).

proxy: A network node that accepts network traffic originating from one network agent and

transmits it to another network agent.

reply URL: The URL of the response entity.

request entity: The server's copy of an entity being uploaded from the client.

response entity: An entity that maintains the response data from the server application. See

section 1.3.3 for more information.

server application: The application that listens to the notification URL in [MC-BUP] section

3.2.1.1. This is also called a back-end server.

Transport Layer Security (TLS): A security protocol that supports confidentiality and integrity of
messages in client and server applications communicating over open networks. TLS supports
server and, optionally, client authentication by using X.509 certificates (as specified in [X509]).
TLS is standardized in the IETF TLS working group.

Universal Naming Convention (UNC): A string format that specifies the location of a resource.

For more information, see [MS-DTYP] section 2.2.57.

upload-reply: A type of upload where the server application sends a response entity to the
client upon receiving and processing the complete request entity. See section 1.3.3 for more
information.

virtual directory: A URL prefix that corresponds to a physical directory on the server.

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

### 1.3 Overview

The Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) Upload Protocol, hereafter called the BITS Upload
Protocol, defines a way to transfer large payloads from a client to an HTTP server or vice versa, even
in the face of interruptions, by sending the payload in multiple fragments. Both HTTP and HTTPS are
supported. For more information see [MSDN-BITS].

The protocol allows a client to pause, resume, or cancel a transfer.

A client can also limit the rate of bandwidth used by manipulating the length and pace of the
transmitted fragments; details are beyond the scope of this specification.

The protocol defines a method for the server to send a notification to a server application about the
availability of a payload upon completion of the upload and to send the response data from the server
application to the client.

A download from the server to the client follows standard HTTP GET syntax, using byte ranges to
control the length of downloaded fragments. The message flow is summarized below:

1.  The client optionally determines the length of the content using a HEAD request.

2.  The client downloads the content by sending one or more GET requests. If the request does not
encompass the entire URL, the GET request identifies the requested fragment using the Range:
header.

An upload from client to server uses the message flow below.

Figure 1: Various messages exchanged among the roles as part of the protocol

In the preceding diagram, the dotted lines indicate messages that are sent only in some variations of
the protocol. The following sections describe the message flow for each type of upload, and the
examples in section 4 contain detailed examples of each of the messages.

Uploads can be accomplished in two modes: upload and upload-reply. The details about the
messages exchanged in each mode are mentioned later.

#### 1.3.1 Message Flow Common to Both Modes

The following steps describe the message flow process that is common to both modes of operation.

The client gets the request entity and the destination URL through the higher-layer protocol.

Release: April 23, 2024

1.  The client initiates the upload by sending a CREATE-SESSION (section 2.2.2) message, which

prompts the server to create a BITS session for the destination URL.

2.  After the BITS session is created, the server sends a BITS session ID through an Ack

response (section 2.2.3).

3.  After the client determines that the BITS session creation was successful, it sends the request

entity in a set of FRAGMENT (section 2.2.6) messages to the server. For each fragment being sent
from the client, the server processes and updates its copy of the request entity.

4.  After the FRAGMENT (section 2.2.6) is successfully received and processed, the server sends

Ack (section 2.2.7) with the byte range received.

#### 1.3.2 Message Flow for Upload Mode

In this mode, the request entity is uploaded to the server. Figure 1 (section 1.3) explains this mode
of operation in detail.

1.  Steps 1 through 5, described in section 1.3.1, are executed.

2.  After the final FRAGMENT message is processed successfully by the server, the request entity is

reassembled at the server. Depending on the notification options (section 3.2.1.1)
(NotificationType and NotificationURL) defined on the back-end client, the back-end client can
send the request entity to the server application provided through the notificationURL. This step is
needed ONLY if the back-end server needs to be notified about the request entity and is not
necessary for a simple upload.

3.  After the server sends a success Ack response to the final FRAGMENT message, the client sends a
CLOSE-SESSION (section 2.2.8) message, which prompts the server to move the request entity to
the destination URL and delete BITS session data for the given session on the server.

#### 1.3.3 Message Flow for Upload-Reply Mode

In this mode, the server sends the request entity to the server application, which constructs a
response entity. The server application sends the URL of the reply to the client as part of the
response to the final FRAGMENT sent from the client. The following steps, along with the diagram in
section 1.3, explain this mode of operation in detail.

1.  Steps 1 through 5, described in section 1.3.1, are executed.

2.  After the final FRAGMENT (section 2.2.6) message is processed successfully by the server, the

server sends the path to the request entity to the back-end client.

3.  The back-end client sends the request entity to the server application provided through the

notificationURL.

4.  The server application sends a reply URL to the back-end client. The back-end client sends this

information to the server. The server sends this information to the client as part of a header in the
Ack (section 2.2.7) response for the final FRAGMENT message.

5.  The client passes the reply URL to the higher-layer protocol. The download of the reply URL by the

higher-layer protocol is beyond the scope of this document.

6.  The client sends a CLOSE-SESSION (section 2.2.8) message, which prompts the server to move

the request entity to the destination URL and delete BITS session data for the given session on
the server.

#### 1.3.4 Message Flow Optional in Both Modes

##### 1.3.4.1 Canceling an Upload

If at any time during the upload, the client sends a CANCEL-SESSION (section 2.2.10) message to the
server, the server deletes the BITS session data it maintains for the corresponding session
represented through the BITS session ID and then replies with an Ack.

##### 1.3.4.2 Uploading to an Alternate Server

If the destination URL refers to a network load balancer or multiple servers, it is possible that the
messages sent as part of each request could be forwarded to a different server behind the load
balancer, depending on the server configuration.

In order to have the messages related to a given request entity sent only to a specific server, this
protocol provides the capability of sending the server's unique address as part of the BITS-Host-ID
header as part of the Ack to the CREATE-SESSION message. See section 2.2.3 for the message format
for the Ack to CREATE-SESSION.

After the client sees that BITS-Host-ID header fields are sent from the server, it replaces the host in
the destination URL with the value of the BITS-Host-Id (section 2.2.3.2) header field, and it sends the
future message requests related to the given upload to the updated destination URL. Header fields are
used as specified in [RFC2616] section 4.2.

If the client makes no progress in the time interval provided through BITS-Host-Id-Fallback-Timeout
(as specified in section 2.2.3), the client reverts to the origin server and continues the given upload.

See the state diagram in section 3.1.1.2 for the use of BITS-Host-ID and BITS-Host-Id-Fallback-
Timeout.

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol is built on top of the HTTP 1.1 Protocol and has direct dependency on it. Depending on
the authentication mechanism needed to perform the upload to a URL, this protocol can also have
dependency on authentication protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC2818].

### 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

None.

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is best suited for transferring large entities over networks with frequent disconnections.

This protocol can be used along with a rate throttling mechanism to throttle the transfers.

If an entity can be uploaded in a single fragment, this protocol is less efficient than an HTTP PUT or
POST.

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas.

#### 1.7.1 Client to Server Upload

  Supported Transports: This protocol is implemented on top of HTTP 1.1 as discussed in section

2.2.

  Capability Negotiation: The client sends the supported protocols initially as part of the CREATE-

SESSION message request. The server picks the best protocol it can use to talk to the client and
sends it as part of the Ack response for CREATE-SESSION. This version of the specification defines
a single protocol whose identifying GUID is {7df0354d-249b-430f-820d-3d2a9bef4931}.

#### 1.7.2 Server to Client Download

  Capability Negotiation: A client using multi-range HTTP requests can detect a server that does not

support multi-range requests and then retry using single-range requests.

#### 1.7.3 Back-End Client to Server Application

This protocol does not define an explicit system for version negotiation between the back-end client
and the server application. The presence of individual capabilities is implicitly signaled in each
message by the presence or absence of optional fields. See sections 2.2.12 and 2.2.13 for details of
each message. No optional capabilities are defined in this version of the specification.

### 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses HRESULT values as defined in [MS-ERREF]. Vendors can define their own HRESULT
values, provided they set the C bit (0x20000000) for each vendor-defined value, indicating that the
value is a customer code.

### 1.9 Standards Assignments

None.

### 2.1 Transport

The client, server, or proxy MAY impose additional requirements on authentication as part of the
transfer. In these cases, authentication information MUST be exchanged between the client, server,
and proxy as required by HTTP and the relevant authentication protocol.<1>

### 2.2 Upload Message Syntax

Messages follow HTTP 1.1 syntax. The required HTTP headers and the format of the HTTP message
body, as specified in section 4.3 of [RFC2616], for each message are described later. An
implementation MAY include additional HTTP headers in each message, following the rules in
[RFC2616], and MUST treat recognized headers according to their standard meaning in [RFC2616].

A future version of this protocol MAY define new HTTP header fields. The recipient of a message MUST
ignore any header fields that it does not understand.

#### 2.2.1 Common Among the Message Types

The HTTP version MUST be 1.1.

Each message includes a number of fields in the HTTP message header. Some of them are standard
fields, as specified in [RFC2616], that are required to take on specific values, whereas others are new
fields defined by the BITS Upload Protocol. The fields MUST follow the rules defined in [RFC2616]
section 4.2.

Each request message MUST be sent as an HTTP extension-method (as discussed in [RFC2616]
section 5.1.1) called BITS_POST.

Each response message MUST follow the rules defined in [RFC2616] section 6.

The size of the value of a header field SHOULD NOT<2> be more than 4 kilobytes.

Each response message MUST include a BITS-specific HTTP message header field named BITS-
Package-Type with the field value Ack.

##### 2.2.1.1 Standard HTTP Header Fields

Content-Name: This indicates the name of the request entity. This SHOULD follow the rules
mentioned for field content in [RFC2616] section 4.2. The length SHOULD NOT exceed 260 characters.
The value passed through this header is not currently being used on the server.<3>

Content-Length: This indicates the number of bytes being included in the message body of the request
or the response. This MUST follow the rules described in [RFC2616] section 14.13. This field MUST be
present for all the request messages in section 2.2.

##### 2.2.1.2 HTTP Header Fields Introduced by the BITS Upload Protocol

BITS-Packet-Type: This represents the type of the message being sent from client to server or server
to client. This is a string of characters and MUST be one of the following: CREATE-SESSION, PING,
FRAGMENT, CLOSE-SESSION, CANCEL-SESSION, or Ack. This field MUST be present for all the request
and response messages defined in section 2.2 except sections 2.2.12 and 2.2.13.

BITS-Session-Id: A GUID (as specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.3.4.3), which MUST be unique

among all sessions on a particular server, that identifies the BITS session for the given request

entity. This field MUST be present in all request messages except CREATE-SESSION. The field
MUST be present in response messages with an HTTP status of 200. It MAY be present in other
response messages; if present, its value MUST be the same as in the corresponding request
message.

BITS-Error: An HRESULT value that represents the error returned from the BITS server. This header

SHOULD be included only if the HTTP status code is not 200.<4>

BITS-Error-Context: This specifies the context in which the error was generated. This MUST be
CONTEXT_SERVER (0x5) if the error was encountered during the message processing on the
server or CONTEXT_REMOTE_APPLICATION (0x7) if the error was returned from the server
application. This header MUST be included only if BITS-Error is present.

The errors that could be returned from the server to the client are described in the following table.

BITS-Packet-Type (section 2.2.1.2): The value MUST be Ack.

BITS-Error (section 2.2.1.2): This field MUST be present if the server encountered an error processing
the request and MUST NOT be present otherwise.

BITS-Error-Context (section 2.2.1.2): This field MUST be present if the server encountered an error
processing the request and MUST NOT be present otherwise.

##### 2.2.5.3 Message Body

This message MUST NOT contain any message body.

#### 2.2.6 FRAGMENT

The client MUST use this message to send a block of data from the request entity to the destination
URL. The intent of the protocol is for the client to send the data in one or more nonoverlapping
fragments, starting with the first byte of the request entity and proceeding to the last byte. However,
in several cases the client state and server state can hold different values for the next byte to be
transferred. For instance:

  When a previous FRAGMENT message was interrupted due to a transient failure in the network,

the client, or the server.

  When the server or client state changes due to external events such as restoration from a backup.

  When the client's current fragment is sent to a different server than previous fragments, for

example, because the client's HostID fallback timer expires.

See section 3.2.5.1.2 for the validation required of the server.

The client and server MAY impose limits on the minimum and maximum length of a fragment's
body.<10>

##### 2.2.6.1 Standard HTTP Header Fields

Content-Name (section 2.2.1.1): This SHOULD be sent with the first fragment message and MAY be
sent with the other fragment messages. This value SHOULD match the Content-Name value sent as
part of a CREATE-SESSION (section 2.2.2) message.<11>

Content-Length (section 2.2.1.1): This specifies the length of the data being uploaded.

Content-Range: This specifies start and end offsets of the request entity being sent as part of this
message, using the format in section 14.16 of [RFC2616]. This field MUST be present.

## 3 Protocol Details

### 3.1 Upload Client Details

#### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation
maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the
explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations
adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this
document.

##### 3.1.1.1 UploadEntityInfo

The client maintains the following information about the upload:

SourceEntityBuffer: The buffer that contains data passed by a higher-layer protocol that needs to be

uploaded.

SourceEntityName: This represents the value sent as part of the Content-Name (section 2.2.1.1)

header field.

SourceEntitySize: A 64-bit integer that holds the size of the data being uploaded.

Destination URL: See section 1.1.

AuthCredentials: The authentication information passed by the higher-layer protocol. The format of

this information MUST be same as that defined by the authentication protocols.

##### 3.1.1.2 HTTPUploader

HTTPUploader encapsulates state associated with the upload of a specific request entity.
HTTPUploader can be represented in the following states.

 State

 Description

STATE_INIT

This is the initial state for the machine.

STATE_CREATE_SESSION  The HTTPUploader sends a CREATE-SESSION message to the server and reads the

response headers.

STATE_PING

The HTTPUploader sends a PING message to the server and reads the response
headers.

STATE_FRAGMENT

The HTTPUploader sends a block of data from the request entity as part of the
FRAGMENT message and reads the response headers.

STATE_COMPLETE

The HTTPUploader sends a CLOSE-SESSION to the server. Request entity upload is
complete at this point. This is a terminal state.

STATE_CANCEL

STATE_ERROR

The HTTPUploader sends a CANCEL-SESSION to the server. Request entity upload is
canceled at this point. This is a terminal state.

The HTTPUploader receives the error message and would wait for the higher-layer
protocol to resume. STATUS_CODE will have information about various error
messages.

STATE_GET_REPLY

The HTTPUploader informs the higher-layer protocol to download the response

 State

 Description

entity. The download of the reply is dependent on the implementation in the higher-
layer protocol.

STATE_SUSPEND

The HTTPUploader pauses the existing upload and would wait for the higher-layer
protocol to resume.

HTTPUploader contains several state elements, described as follows:

Pointer to the UploadEntityInfo passed by the higher-layer protocol.

FRAGMENT-START-OFFSET: A 64-bit integer that represents the offset at which the given block of
data is written in the destination URL.

FRAGMENT-BUFFER: A buffer to hold the fragment data being sent. This MUST be equal to or greater
than the FRAGMENT-LENGTH size.

FRAGMENT-LENGTH: A 64-bit integer that represents the length of the fragment being sent.

HTTPStatusCode: This represents the HTTP status code (as described in [RFC2616] section 10)
returned from the server.

BitsErrorCode: This represents BITS-Error (section 2.2.1.2).

BitsErrorContext: This represents BITS-Error-Context (section 2.2.1.2).

BytesTransferred: A 64-bit integer that holds the number of bytes uploaded so far.

state: The state as shown in Figure 4.

Origin server: The host specified in the destination URL sent by the higher-layer protocol.

BITSSessionId (section 2.2.1.2): The BITS session ID for the current upload session.

BitsHostID (section 2.2.1.2): See the BITS-Host-ID header field in section 2.2.3.2 for a detailed
description. Initially, the value is NULL.

BitsHostIDFallbackTimeout (section 2.2.1.2): See the BITS-Host-Id-Fallback-Timeout header field in
section 2.2.3.2 for a detailed description. Initially, the time-out value is 0xFFFFFFFF.

Reply URL (section 1.1): Initially, the value is NULL.

UploadSuspended: TRUE if the upload has been suspended by the higher-layer protocol. FALSE
otherwise.

Various errors that could be returned from the client to the higher-layer protocol are as follows. In
addition to the following, the errors sent from the server to the client (as specified in section 2.2.1.2)
are sent to the higher-layer protocol unmodified.

 STATUS_CODE

 Description

ERROR_AUTH_REQUIRED  The server requires the client to authenticate to proceed with the upload.

ERROR_TRANSPORT

A lower-layer transport encountered an error.

ERROR_TIMEOUT

The request was not sent, or the response was not received within the time limit. See
section 3.1.2 for more details.

##### 3.1.2.3 Host Fallback Timeout

This timer limits the amount of time taken for the client to reconnect to the host name specified in the
BITS-Host-ID header before reverting to the host name specified in the destination URL. The
default value is 0xffffffff, meaning INFINITE; the legal range is any positive value.

#### 3.1.3 Initialization

None.

#### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

##### 3.1.4.1 New Upload Request

The higher-layer protocol MUST populate the SourceEntityBuffer, SourceEntityName, SourceEntitySize,
destination URL, and AuthCredentials member variables of the UploadEntityInfo (section 3.1.1.1)
object and pass the UploadEntityInfo object to the client. The client sets the UploadEntityInfo.state to
STATE_INIT, instantiates the HTTPUploader object, and passes the UploadEntityInfo object to it. The
client returns the reference to the HTTPUploader object to the higher-layer protocol.

##### 3.1.4.2 Pause Existing Upload

The higher-layer protocol might interrupt the existing upload. For this, the higher-layer protocol MUST
pass the reference to the HTTPUploader object provided as part of 3.1.4.1.

The client MUST set HTTPUploader.UploadSuspended to TRUE and wait for UploadEntityInfo.state to
become STATE_SUSPEND.

##### 3.1.4.3 Resume Existing Upload

The higher-layer protocol might resume the existing upload; either it was interrupted through a Pause
Existing Upload event (section 3.1.4.2) or some error occurred that was sent to the higher-layer
protocol for further processing. For this, the higher-layer protocol MUST pass the reference to the
HTTPUploader object provided as part of section 3.1.4.1.

 If the higher-layer protocol passes authentication info
    populate HTTPUploader.AuthCredentials accordingly.

 Set HTTPUploader.UploadSuspended to FALSE
 Set HTTPUploader.State to PING

##### 3.1.4.4 Cancel Existing Upload

The higher-layer protocol might cancel the existing upload. For this, the higher-layer protocol MUST
pass the reference to the HTTPUploader object provided as part of section 3.1.4.1.

 Set HTTPUploader.UploadSuspended to FALSE
 Set HTTPUploader.State to CANCEL

If the HTTP status code is 401 or 407, the client MUST follow the rules defined in [RFC2617] and
[RFC2616] regarding sending the response for the authentication challenge.

If the HTTP status code is 403, the user does not have access rights to upload the request entity to
the location specified through the destination URL. The client MUST return this error to the higher-
layer protocol so that the necessary steps can be taken.

If the HTTP status code is 501 and the BITS-Error value returned as part of the response is
x80070005, uploads are not enabled for the virtual directory, where the destination URL MUST be
present. The client MUST return this error to the higher-layer protocol so that the necessary steps can
be taken.

If the BITS-Error value returned as part of the response is x8020001F, the client MUST restart the
upload with a CREATE-SESSION message. This is true for all the messages except CANCEL-SESSION
(section 3.1.5.2.6).

If the BITS-Error value returned as part of the response is x80200020, it means that the size of the
request entity is larger than the maximum request entity size specified for the virtual directory, as
discussed in section 2.2.1.2. The client MUST return this error to the higher-layer protocol so that the
necessary steps can be taken.

If the BITS-Error value returned as part of the response is x80070057, the values of the headers sent
from the client do not satisfy the message rules previously specified. The client MUST return this error
to the higher-layer protocol so that the necessary steps can be taken.

For all other HTTP status codes returned from the server that have a valid BITS-error, the client MUST
return this error to the higher-layer protocol so that the necessary steps can be taken.

Release: April 23, 2024


For all other HTTP status codes as specified in [RFC2616] section 10, the client MUST return this error
to the higher-layer protocol so that the necessary steps can be taken.

The upload request timer MUST be started before each message is sent to the server. It MUST be
stopped when the send is complete.

The upload response timer MUST be started before the response is requested from the server. It
MUST be stopped when the response from the server is received with either a success status code or a
failure status code.

###### 3.1.5.2.2 CREATE-SESSION Response

The client MUST verify that the message satisfies the requirements in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.3,
discarding the message if not.

If the HTTP status code is 200, the request was successful and BITS session–specific information has
been set up for upload on the server.

If the HTTP status code is 200, as specified in section 3.1.5.1.2 the client MUST update the fields in
HTTPUploader with the values returned through the response headers. See section 2.2.3.2 for the
headers returned. The client MUST update the destination URL as described in BITS-Host-ID in
section 2.2.3.2. The client SHOULD send a PING message request to the host, sent through BITS-
Host-ID, to validate that the host can be contacted.

For handling other HTTP status codes, see section 3.1.5.2.1.

###### 3.1.5.2.3 PING Response

The client MUST verify that the message satisfies the requirements in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.5,
discarding the message if not.

If the result is 200, the request was successful.

For handling other HTTP status codes, refer to 3.1.5.2.1.

###### 3.1.5.2.4 FRAGMENT Response

The client MUST verify that the message satisfies the requirements in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.7,
discarding the message if not.

If the HTTP status code is 200 or 416, the client MUST perform necessary checks on the value
received through BITS-Received-Content-Range and update the fragment offset as shown in the state
logic in section 3.1.5.1.4.

If the HTTP status code is 413 (request too large), the client SHOULD send fragments of smaller sizes
until 413 error is not returned from the server. The maximum size of fragment allowed and the size of
the fragment being sent from the client are implementation-specific.<16>

In upload-reply mode, the server MUST send Reply-URL as part of uploading the final fragment. If
the server does not send Reply-URL, the client MUST report the error to the higher-layer protocol.
More details of state transitions can be found in section 3.1.5.1.8.

For handling other HTTP status codes, refer to section 3.1.5.2.1.

###### 3.1.5.2.5 CLOSE-SESSION Response

The client MUST verify that the message satisfies the requirements in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.9,
discarding the message if not.

If the HTTP status code is 200, the server has successfully cleaned up BITS session–specific data for
the given upload. More details of state transitions based on the response information can be found in
section 3.1.5.1.5.

For handling other HTTP status codes, refer to section 3.1.5.2.1.

###### 3.1.5.2.6 CANCEL-SESSION Response

The client MUST verify that the message satisfies the requirements in sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.11,
discarding the message if not.

If the HTTP status code is 200, the server has successfully cleaned up BITS session-specific data for
the given upload. More details of state transitions based on the response is in section 3.1.5.1.6.

For handling other HTTP status codes, refer to section 3.1.5.2.1.

#### 3.1.6 Timer Events

##### 3.1.6.1 Upload Request Timeout

The client cancels the current request, sets the state to STATE_SUSPENDED, and sends
ERROR_TIMEOUT to the higher-layer protocol.

##### 3.1.6.2 Upload Response Timeout

The client cancels the current request, sets the state to STATE_SUSPENDED, and sends
ERROR_TIMEOUT to the higher-layer protocol.

##### 3.1.6.3 Host Fallback Timeout

The client MUST send future messages to the host in the destination URL, not the address in
BitsHostID. See section 3.1.5.1.7 for more details.

#### 3.1.7 Other Local Events

##### 3.1.7.1 Transport Error Occurred During the Transfer

The client sends ERROR_TRANSPORT to the higher-layer protocol.

### 3.2 Upload Server Details

An implementation that includes the upload mode SHOULD also implement the notification semantics
presented in this section and in sections 3.3 and 3.4. If the implementation also implements the
upload-reply of this protocol, it MUST implement the notification semantics as described in sections
### 3.3 and 3.4.

3.2.1  Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation
maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the
explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations
adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this
document.

request entity in the location provided through the destination URL. This value is not legal for
upload-reply mode.

  NOTIFICATION_BY_REFERENCE: The back-end client MUST pass the physical path of the
request entity to the server application specified in the NotificationURL state element.

  NOTIFICATION_BY_VALUE: The back-end client MUST pass request entity data in the body of

the request to the server application specified in the NotificationURL property.

NotificationURL: (Optional) This specifies the URL of the server application to which the server sends

the request entity. This MUST be present if NotificationType property is not NONE.<19>

BITSHostId: If nonempty, this specifies the value of the Bits-Host-Id (section 2.2.3.2) header field to

be returned in the reply to a CREATE-SESSION message.

BITSHostIdFallbackTimeout: If nonzero, this specifies the value of the Bits-HostId-Fallback-

Timeout (section 2.2.3.2) header field to be returned in the reply to a CREATE-SESSION message.

AllowOverwrites: A Boolean value that indicates whether a request entity can overwrite an existing

entity with the same name.

3.2.1.2  ServerPortListener

The ServerPortListener role is to listen to the incoming messages from various clients and forward
them to the appropriate handlers.

3.2.1.3  BITSSessionManager

The role of BITSSessionManager is to forward the message BITSSessionWrapper object that is
associated with the BITS session ID value sent as part of the message.

3.2.1.3.1 Table of Active Sessions

Each row of this table contains a BITS session ID and a reference to the corresponding
BITSSessionWrapper object. The table contains one row for each upload session known to the BITS
server.

3.2.1.4  BITSSessionWrapper

BITSSessionWrapper encapsulates the state associated with the upload of a specific request entity.

A BITSSessionWrapper object contains the following properties:

Release: April 23, 2024


  BITSSessionId: This refers to BITS-Session-Id (section 2.2.3.2).

  State: This represents the current active state of a BITSSessionWrapper object. This is an

enumeration and contains one of the values mentioned in the following state table.

  DestinationURL: This refers to the destination URL.

  RequestEntityPath: This represents the physical path to the request entity for the upload. The

rules specified for the Content-Name (section 2.2.1.1) header (maximum character limit, range of
characters that can be used) apply to this as well.

  ResponseEntityPath: This represents the physical path to the response entity used in upload-

reply mode. The rules specified for Content-Name (section 2.2.1.1) header (maximum character
limit, range of characters that can be used) apply to this as well.

  UploadEntitySize: A 64-bit integer that represents the number of bytes of the request entity.

  ReplyURL: This is the same as reply URL.

  UploadComplete: A Boolean value that represents whether the server has all the bytes of the

request entity.<20>

  NotifyCache: A Boolean value that specifies whether the communication with the back-end client

is complete.

  ShouldcopyToDestination: A Boolean value that specifies whether the destination URL is

populated.

  HTTPStatusCode: This represents HTTP status code as described in [RFC2616] section 10.

  BitsErrorCode: This represents BITS-Error (section 2.2.1.2).

  BitsErrorContext: This represents BITS-Error-Context (section 2.2.1.2).

Apply the message processing rules as described in sections 3.2.5.2.1, 3.2.5.2.3, and 3.2.5.2.8.

3.2.5.2  Message Processing

3.2.5.2.1 General Rules for HTTP-Level Error Responses

This section describes several circumstances where the server's response to an incoming message is a
response at the HTTP level rather than a message from section 2.2. In all such cases, the response
MUST conform to the format defined in section 6 of [RFC2616]. The HTTP message body of these
messages SHOULD be empty.

3.2.5.2.2 Message Flow

After BITSSessionManager (section 3.2.1.3) receives the message from
ServerPortListener (section 3.2.1.2), it parses the message to obtain the message type and BITS
session ID. Detailed information about the headers can be found in section 2.2.1.

 If (the message type is CREATE-SESSION)
    Create a new BITSSessionWrapper object and pass the message info
    Add a corresponding row to the table of active sessions.

 If (message type is PING)
    Send response to the client with the message format described in 2.2.5

 If (the message type is not CREATE-SESSION and not a PING)
    Obtain the BITS-Session-Id header value
    Find the session ID in the table of active sessions
    Send the message info to the corresponding BITSSessionWrapper object.

 If (error occurs in any of the above actions)
    Return error response to the client.

The message format for responses for the corresponding request messages can be found in section
2.2.

3.2.5.2.3 Common Message Validation

See section 2.2.1 for more details about the common standard HTTP headers and HTTP headers
specific to the BITS Upload Protocol. The response sent from the server in the discussion that follows
MUST be based on the type of message received from the client (except PING messages). See
sections 2.2.3, 2.2.7, 2.2.9, and 2.2.11 for the message format of various responses sent from the
server.

The server MUST verify that the request message satisfies the requirements in section 2.2. If the
request message fails to satisfy the requirements, the server MUST send a 400 HTTP status code with
BITS-Error 0x80070057, BITS-Error-Context 0x5.

The server MUST check whether the client has sufficient access permissions to upload the request
entity to the location provided through the destination URL. If not, the server MUST send a 403
HTTP status code with BITS-Error 0x80070005, BITS-Error-Context 0x5.

The request MUST contain a Content-Length header. If not, the server MUST reject the message and
SHOULD return a 411 HTTP status code with BITS-Error 0x80070057, BITS-Error-Context 0x5.<23>

Except for the CREATE-SESSION message, the server MUST validate that the BITS session ID sent
from the client is one of the active BITS sessions on the server. If no corresponding active BITS
session exists on the server, the server MUST return a 500 HTTP status code with BITS-Error
x8020001F, BITS-Error-Context 0x5.

After the initial validation has succeeded, the server uses the BITS-Packet-Type header to determine
the message type and processes the message as appropriate. Specific actions for each message type
are described in the following sections.

3.2.5.2.4 CREATE-SESSION REQUEST

The server MUST validate that it supports at least one of the supported protocols sent by the client. If
no supported protocols are common between the client and the server, the server MUST send an HTTP
status code as 400 and a BITS-Error as x80070057, BITS-Error-Context 0x5.

The server MUST generate a GUID (as specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.3.4.3) for BITS session ID
and store it in BITSSessionWrapper for the upload.

The server SHOULD<24> create a temporary location for storing the request entity being uploaded
before updating the final destination entity.

If BITSHostId or BITSHostIdFallbackTimeout is specified for the virtual directory, the server
SHOULD<25> send these headers as part of the response sent to the client.

If the create-session request is completed successfully or failed for some reason, the server MUST
send the response as described in section 2.2.3.

3.2.5.2.5 PING REQUEST

No special processing is done for handling this request.

The server MUST send the response as described in section 2.2.5 with HTTP status code 200.

3.2.5.2.6 FRAGMENT REQUEST

If the start offset of Content-Range received as part of the current fragment is not the start offset of
the next block of data that the server receives, the server MUST return a response as described in
section 2.2.7 with HTTP status code 416 and with BITS-Received-Content-Range as the start offset
that the client MUST send as part of the next fragment request.

All the rules described in [RFC2616] section 14.16 related to Content-Range would apply while the
Content-Range header value received from the client is being processed. The server MUST return a
response as described in section 2.2.7 with HTTP status code 400 and with BITS-Error as x80070057,
BITS-Error-Context as 0x5.

The server MUST send the response as described in section 2.2.7. The BITS-Error-Context MUST be
returned as 0x7 if an error was returned from the back-end client.

Release: April 23, 2024

42 / 91


3.2.5.2.7 CLOSE-SESSION REQUEST

The server MUST move the request entity to the final destination to complete the upload. The server
MUST delete the request entity and other state data associated with the BITS session. If the server
finds that the request entity was deleted, the server MUST return a response as described in section
2.2.9 with HTTP status code 404.

If ResponseEntityPath was returned from the back-end client, the server MUST delete it.

The server MUST send the response as described in section 2.2.9.

3.2.5.2.8 CANCEL-SESSION REQUEST

The server MUST delete the request entity, response entity, and other state data associated with
the BITS session.

If ResponseEntityPath was returned from the back-end client, the server MUST delete it.

The server MUST send the response as described in section 2.2.11.

3.2.6  Timer Events

3.2.6.1  BITS Session Timeout

When the time-out is hit, the server MUST clean up all the data associated with the session and
remove its row from the BITSSessionManager (section 3.2.1.3) table of active sessions. Setting a
short session time-out is an issue if the client needs to download replyURL, depending on the cleanup
semantics implemented on the server.

3.2.7  Other Local Events

The server MAY choose to reduce the number of active sessions in response to implementation-
dependent criteria, such as resource limits or detection of a denial-of-service attack.<26> The
affected sessions MUST be cleaned up as described in section 3.2.6.1.

3.3  Back-End Client Details

The back-end client is an optional role responsible for sending a reassembled request entity from
the BITS server to a server application. If the server URL is configured as an upload-reply URL, the
back-end client also receives the server application's reply data and makes it available to the BITS
server.

#### 3.3.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation
maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the
explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations
adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this
document.

##### 3.3.1.1 Back-End Client's State

The back-end client uses the following state elements:

  NotificationType: An enumeration value that represents the way the request entity is sent to the

server application. This has the following values:

43 / 91

[MC-BUP] - v20240423
Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) Upload Protocol

Release: April 23, 2024


  NONE: No server application is associated with the server URL. The request entity is not sent
to the server application. The server populates the request entity in the location provided
through the destination URL.

  NOTIFICATION_BY_REFERENCE: The back-end client passes the physical path of the request

entity to the server application specified in the NotificationURL state element.

  NOTIFICATION_BY_VALUE: The back-end client passes request entity data in the body of the

request to the server application specified in the NotificationURL property.

  NotificationURL (Optional): This specifies the URL of the server application to which the server

sends the request entity. This MUST be present if the NotificationType property is not NONE.

  DestinationURL: This SHOULD be passed from the upload server. This is the same as destination

URL.

  RequestEntityPath (section 3.2.1.4): This SHOULD be passed from the upload server.

  ResponseEntityPath: This represents the physical path to the request entity used in upload-
reply (section 1.3.3) mode. The rules specified for Content-Name (section 2.2.1.1) header
(maximum character limit, range of characters that can be used) apply to this as well. This
information is passed to the upload server.

  ReplyURL: This is same as reply URL.

  HTTPStatusCode: This represents the HTTP status code as described in [RFC2616] section 10. This

is returned to a server component.

  BitsErrorCode: This represents BITS-Error (section 2.2.1.2).

  ShouldcopyToDestination: A Boolean value that specifies whether the destination URL is

populated.



IsReplyStaticURL: A Boolean value that specifies whether the response sent from the server is a
static URL that can be directly downloaded by the client.

The back-end client can be represented in the following states:

##### 3.3.5.3 Message Processing

###### 3.3.5.3.1 General Rules for HTTP-Level Error Responses

This section describes several circumstances where the server's response to an incoming message is a
response at the HTTP level rather than a message from section 2.2. In all such cases, the response
MUST conform to the format defined in section 6 of [RFC2616]. The HTTP message body of these
messages SHOULD be empty.

###### 3.3.5.3.2 Notification Response

The back-end client MUST validate the following aspects of a received message before determining
the message type:



The HTTP version MUST be 1.1.

The back-end client MUST verify that the response message satisfies the requirements in section
2.2.13. If the requirements are not satisfied, the back-end client SHOULD<27> send a 411 HTTP
status code with BITS-Error 0x80070057 to the server, which will be sent to the client.

More details about message processing can be found in sections 3.3.5.2.4 and 3.3.5.2.5.

status code as 408, BITS-Error as x80070112, and BITS-Error-Context as
CONTEXT_REMOTE_APPLICATION to the client.

##### 3.3.6.3 Notification Receive Response Timeout

The back-end client SHOULD abort the notification processing and enter STATE_ERROR HTTP status
code as 408, BITS-Error as x80070112, and BITS-Error-Context as CONTEXT_REMOTE_APPLICATION
to the client.

#### 3.3.7 Other Local Events

None.

### 3.4 Server Application Details

#### 3.4.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation
maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the
explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations
adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this
document.

The server application maintains the following state elements:









 StaticResponseURL: The URL that is sent with the BITS-Static-Response-URL header.

 RemoteUploadURL: This is the same as the destination URL.

 UploadedEntityPath: The local path where the request entity received from the server is stored.

 ReplyEntityPath: The local path that contains the response entity that is passed to the server.

#### 3.4.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

##### 3.4.5.1 General Rules for HTTP-Level Error Responses

This section describes several circumstances where the server's response to an incoming message is a
response at the HTTP level rather than a message from section 2.2. In all such cases, the response
MUST conform to the format defined in section 6 of [RFC2616]. The HTTP message body of these
messages SHOULD be empty.

##### 3.4.5.2 Notification Request

The server MUST validate the following aspects of a received message before determining the
message type:



The HTTP version MUST be 1.1.

The server application MUST verify that the request message satisfies the requirements in section
2.2.12. If it fails to satisfy the requirements, the server application MUST send a valid HTTP status
code based on rules defined in [RFC2616].

If the server application plans to access the uploaded data through BITS-Original-Request-URL, the
server application MUST store the value in RemoteUploadURL and send the message response in the
format described in section 2.2.13 with the BITS-Copy-File-To-Destination header field.

If the request's HTTP headers include both the BITS-Request-DataFile-Name and BITS-Response-
DataFile-Name header fields, the back-end client is configured to pass the request and response
entities by reference. The server SHOULD process the request entity by implementation-defined
means and MUST specify the reply data by one of two means:

  Omit the BITS-Static-Response-URL header field from its HTTP response, and write the data of the

response entity as the message body of its HTTP response.

  Make the data of the response entity available from a URL, and include the BITS-Static-Response-

URL header field in its HTTP response.

Any errors that occur during the preceding interactions MUST be sent to the back-end client.

If the HTTP request lacks both the BITS-Request-DataFile-Name and BITS-Response-DataFile-Name
header fields, the back-end client is configured to pass the request and response entities by value.
The server application MUST read the request entity from the body of the HTTP request. The server
MUST specify the reply data by one of two means:

  Omit the BITS-Static-Response-URL header field from its HTTP response, and write the data of the

response entity as the message body of its HTTP response.

  Make the data of the response entity available from a URL, and include the BITS-Static-Response-

URL header field in its HTTP response.

 Any errors that occur while reading or populating MUST be sent to the back-end client.

### 3.5 Download Server Details

#### 3.5.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation
maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the
explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations
adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this
document.

Conceptually, the download server is acting as a file server, that is, the URL maps to a piece of
content with fixed size and modification time. The server maintains the following data for the URL:

  DATA_BUFFER: A buffer of the URL content.

  DATA_LENGTH: A 64-bit integer containing the length of the URL content.

  DATA_TIMESTAMP: The last-modified time of the URL content.

#### 3.5.2 Timers

None.

#### 3.5.3 Initialization

None.

#### 3.5.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

##### 3.5.4.1 Modify URL Content

The higher-layer protocol MUST pass the new URL content and length. The server MUST set
DATA_BUFFER and DATA_LENGTH to the new values. The server MUST set the DATA_TIMESTAMP to
the current UTC time.

#### 3.5.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The server MUST follow standard message-processing rules in [RFC2616]. In addition:





The server MUST support the GET and HEAD verbs.

The server MUST support HTTP byte-range requests containing a single byte range, as described
in section 14.35 of [RFC2616]. The server SHOULD support byte-range requests containing
multiple byte ranges.

  Successful responses to GET and HEAD requests MUST include the Content-Length header.

##### 3.5.5.1 Receive GET Request

If the request contains a Range: header, the server MUST follow the rules in section 14.35 of
[RFC2616] to validate the byte range(s) being requested and generate an appropriate response
message.

If the status of the resulting response is 200 or 206:



The response byte ranges MUST be taken from the matching ranges of DATA_BUFFER.





The response Last-Modified header MUST be set to DATA_TIMESTAMP. For details, see [RFC2616]
section 14.29.

If the server supports multiple byte-range requests, the response MUST return the byte ranges in
the same order as in the GET request; no merging or reordering of ranges is allowed.

##### 3.5.5.2 Receive HEAD Request

[RFC2616] specifies that the response MUST be identical to the response to a matching GET request,
except that the body of the response is suppressed.

#### 3.5.6 Timer Events

None.

#### 3.5.7 Other Local Events

None.

### 3.6 Download Client Details

The client initializes Table of Contents and sets the Source field of each row to NULL.

Set STATE to STATE_INIT.

Set PEER_RETRY_COUNT = 0.

#### 3.6.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

##### 3.6.4.1 Pause Download

The higher-layer protocol might interrupt the existing download.

The client MUST set SUSPENDED to TRUE and wait for State to become STATE_SUSPEND.

##### 3.6.4.2 Resume Download

The higher-layer protocol might resume the existing download; either it was interrupted through a
Pause download event (section 3.6.4.1) or some error occurred that was sent to the higher-layer
protocol for further processing.

 If the higher-layer protocol passes authentication info
    populate AUTH_CREDENTIALS accordingly.

 Set SUSPENDED to FALSE.

If DATA_TIMESTAMP is UNKNOWN, the client MAY set state to STATE_SIZE in order to determine the
length of the URL prior to download; otherwise it MUST set it to STATE_DOWNLOAD.<29>

##### 3.6.4.3 Cancel Download

The higher-layer protocol might cancel the existing download.

Set STATE to STATE_COMPLETE.

#### 3.6.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

##### 3.6.5.1 Common

The request timer MUST be started before each message is sent to the server. It MUST be stopped
when the send is complete.

 Set SINGLE_RANGE_ONLY to FALSE.

If BPCR_ALLOWED is set to TRUE the client MUST set STATE to STATE_SIZE.

If BPCR_ALLOWED is set to FALSE the client MAY set STATE to STATE_SIZE in order to determine the
length of the URL prior to download; otherwise, it MUST set it to STATE_DOWNLOAD.<30>

###### 3.6.5.2.2 STATE_SIZE

 If (SUSPENDED is TRUE)
    Set state to STATE_SUSPEND
    Return from this state.

 Send HEAD request to the server.

 If (error encountered in send)
    Set state to STATE_SUSPEND.
    Return the error to the higher-layer protocol.

 Receive the HEAD response from the server.

 If (error encountered while receiving or reading the response info)
    Set state to STATE_SUSPEND.
    Return the error to the higher-layer protocol.

 Set DATA_LENGTH to the value of the response’s Content-Length header.
 Set DATA_TIMESTAMP to the value of the response’s Last-Modified header, or UNKNOWN if not
present.

 If (BPCR_ALLOWED is TRUE)
    Set state to STATE_SEARCH
 else
    Set state to STATE_DOWNLOAD.

###### 3.6.5.2.3 STATE_SEARCH

The client initiates a new FileSearchRequest element as specified in [MS-BPCR] section 3.1.4.1 by
setting the values of OriginalUrl to DESTINATION_URL, FileModificationTime to DATA_TIMESTAMP and
FileSize to DATA_LENGTH, and waits for the search to complete.

During this time, The RESULT_FOUND event ([MS-BPCR] section 3.1.7.3.2) is handled as specified in
section 3.6.7.1.

After the search is completed, the client searches the Table of Contents, identifying ranges in
APPLICATION_RANGES that do not have a corresponding row. For each missing range, the client
inserts a row with RECORD_ID set to NULL and Source set to the hostname from DESTINATION_URL.

The client sets STATE to STATE_DOWNLOAD.

###### 3.6.5.2.4 STATE_DOWNLOAD

If SUSPENDED is TRUE, set state to STATE_SUSPEND and return from this state.

If FRAGMENT_OFFSET equals the number of bytes in APPLICATION_RANGES, then the client MUST set
state to STATE_COMPLETE and halt processing of the current state.

Otherwise, determine the size of the fragment, that is, FRAGMENT-LENGTH, by implementation-
dependent means. Set FRAGMENT_RANGES to the byte ranges to be requested using the algorithm in
section 3.6.5.2.4.3.

If BPCR_ALLOWED is FALSE, then download the required contents from the original server as specified
in section 3.6.5.2.4.2.

Otherwise, download the fragment from the peer server as specified in section 3.6.5.2.4.1.

###### 3.6.5.2.4.1 Download from the BITS Peer-Caching: Content Retrieval Protocol Server

Trim FRAGMENT_RANGES and FRAGMENT_LENGTH so that all ranges are provided by a single URL,
using the algorithm in section 3.6.5.2.4.4.

Identify the row index of the row of APPLICATION_RANGES containing the first byte of
FRAGMENT_RANGES. Then look at the row of the Table of Contents with the same index.

If the row's Source is NULL:

  Download the contents from the original server as described in section 3.6.5.2.4.2.

Otherwise:

1.  The offsets in FRAGMENT_RANGES are relative to the URL of the origin server. Transform them

into offsets relative to the peer URL, using the following algorithm:

1.  Let FIRST_INDEX be the row index of APPLICATION_RANGES that contains the first byte of
FRAGMENT_RANGES. Iterate through each range in FRAGMENT_RANGES, proceeding from
first to last.

2.  Let INDEX be the row index of APPLICATION_RANGES that contains the first byte of the

current range.

3.  Set FRAGMENT_RANGES[INDEX].Offset to Table_of_Contents[FIRST_INDEX].Offset.

2.  Send a Download request to the BITS Peer-Caching: Content Retrieval Protocol client ([MS-BPCR]

section 3.1.4.3), passing row.Source as the server address, row.RECORD-ID as the content
record, and FRAGMENT_RANGES as the set of ranges.

3.  In case of a successful download as specified in [MS-BPCR] section 3.1.5.2, copy the body data of

the response ranges to DATA_BUFFER starting at offset FRAGMENT_OFFSET, advance
FRAGMENT_OFFSET by FRAGMENT_LENGTH, then set the state to STATE_DOWNLOAD.

Otherwise:

1.  Remove the peer from the table of servers (as specified in [MS-BPCR] section 3.1.1.1) and

increment PEER_RETRY_COUNT.

2.  If PEER_RETRY_COUNT is less than or equal to 3, client MUST set STATE to STATE_SEARCH,

else set BPCR_ALLOWED to FALSE and set STATE to STATE_DOWNLOAD.

###### 3.6.5.2.4.2 Download from Original Server

Send an HTTP GET request to the server following the format in section 5 of [RFC2616], setting HTTP
header fields as follows:



"Range" header specifies the byte ranges chosen in the previous step, following the rules in
section 14.35 of [RFC2616]. If FRAGMENT_RANGES is a single range covering the entire URL, the
client SHOULD suppress the "Range" header.

If an error is encountered during the send, set state to STATE_SUSPEND and return the error to the
higher-layer protocol.

Receive the response from the server.

[MC-BUP] - v20240423
Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) Upload Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

57 / 91


If an error is encountered while receiving or reading the response info, set state to STATE_SUSPEND
and return the error to the higher-layer protocol.

If FRAGMENT_RANGES contains a single range, validate and read the response as follows:











If DATA_TIMESTAMP is UNKNOWN, set it to the value of the response's Last-Modified header.

If the response's Last-Modified header does not match DATA_TIMESTAMP, then set state to
STATE_INIT, terminating processing of the current state.

If DATA_LENGTH is unknown, set it to the value of the response's Content-Length header.

If the response's Content-Length header does not match DATA_LENGTH, then set state to
STATE_SUSPEND and report an error to the higher-layer protocol.

If the HTTP status is 200 and FRAGMENT_RANGES does not encompass the entire URL, then set
state to STATE_SUSPEND and report an error to the higher-layer protocol.

  Copy the response body data to DATA_BUFFER starting at offset FRAGMENT_OFFSET, then

advance FRAGMENT_OFFSET by FRAGMENT_LENGTH.

  Set state to STATE_DOWNLOAD.

If FRAGMENT_RANGES contains multiple ranges, validate the response as follows. If validation fails,
the client SHOULD set SINGLE_RANGE_ONLY to TRUE and go to state STATE_DOWNLOAD; otherwise,
it MUST set state to STATE_SUSPEND and report an error to the higher-layer protocol.











If the HTTP status is 200, validation fails.

If the response does not follow the format in section 19.2 of [RFC2616], validation fails.

If the byte range specified in any Content-Range header of the response does not match the
corresponding range of FRAGMENT_RANGES, then validation fails.

If DATA_LENGTH is unknown, set it to the value of the first response range's Content-Length
header.

If the URL-length specified in any Content-Range header of the response does not match
DATA_LENGTH, then validation fails.

  Copy the body data of the response ranges to DATA_BUFFER starting at offset

FRAGMENT_OFFSET, then advance FRAGMENT_OFFSET by FRAGMENT_LENGTH.

  Set state to STATE_DOWNLOAD.

###### 3.6.5.2.4.3 Choosing Ranges

The client is given FRAGMENT_LENGTH in bytes, FRAGMENT_OFFSET in bytes, and the array of byte
ranges APPLICATION_RANGES.

To set FRAGMENT_RANGES, the client MUST consider APPLICATION_RANGES as an aggregate
collection of bytes, and FRAGMENT_OFFSET as the starting offset into it. Similarly, it MUST consider
(FRAGMENT_OFFSET+FRAGMENT_LENGTH) as the ending offset. If
(FRAGMENT_OFFSET+FRAGMENT_LENGTH) is greater than the number of bytes in
APPLICATION_RANGES, then it MUST reduce FRAGMENT_LENGTH so that
(FRAGMENT_OFFSET+FRAGMENT_LENGTH) equals the number of bytes in APPLICATION_RANGES.

The subset of ranges bounded by the starting and ending offsets MUST be stored in
FRAGMENT_RANGES.

If SINGLE_RANGE_ONLY is TRUE, remove all but the first range from FRAGMENT_RANGES and set
FRAGMENT_LENGTH to the length of that range.

As a concrete example, assume APPLICATION_RANGES contains the following array of ranges:

  Offset 100, length 100

  Offset 1000, length 100

  Offset 200, length 100

and that FRAGMENT_OFFSET is 25, and FRAGMENT_LENGTH is 200. Then the starting offset is 25
bytes into the first range, and the ending offset is 200 bytes of APPLICATION_RANGES later, or 25
bytes into the third range. Thus, if SINGLE_RANGE_ONLY is false, FRAGMENT_RANGES is

  Offset 125, length 75

  Offset 1000, length 100

  Offset 200, length 25

If SINGLE_RANGE_ONLY is true, then FRAGMENT_RANGES is

  Offset 125, length 75

and FRAGMENT_LENGTH is 75.

Given the same APPLICATION_RANGES with FRAGMENT_OFFSET as 200 and FRAGMENT_LENGTH as
1000, the starting offset is the beginning of the third range.
(FRAGMENT_OFFSET+FRAGMENT_LENGTH) is greater than the 100 bytes remaining in
APPLICATION_RANGES, so FRAGMENT_LENGTH MUST be set to 100 and the resulting
FRAGMENT_RANGES is

  Offset 200, length 100

###### 3.6.5.2.4.4 Trimming a Request to a Single URL

The Table of Contents can include multiple servers and/or peer records. Since a single HTTP request
can contain only one URL, FRAGMENT_RANGES MUST be limited to a set of ranges in a single URL.
This is accomplished by the following algorithm.

Let FIRST_INDEX be the row index of APPLICATION_RANGES that contains the first byte of
FRAGMENT_RANGES. Iterate through each range in FRAGMENT_RANGES, proceeding from first to
last:

1.  Let INDEX be the row index of APPLICATION_RANGES that contains the first byte of the current

range.

2.  If Table_of_Contents[FIRST_INDEX].Source is different than Table_of_Contents[INDEX].Source,
then delete the current range and all following ranges from FRAGMENT_RANGES, subtracting the
same number of bytes from FRAGMENT_LENGTH. Terminate the algorithm.

If Table_of_Contents[FIRST_INDEX].RecordId is different than
Table_of_Contents[INDEX].RecordId, then delete the current range and all following ranges from
FRAGMENT_RANGES, subtracting the same number of bytes from FRAGMENT_LENGTH. Terminate the
algorithm.

###### 3.6.5.2.5 STATE_SUSPEND

Wait for the current state to stop further processing and return. Then return to the higher-layer
protocol.

###### 3.6.5.2.6 STATE_COMPLETE

Signal completion to the higher-layer protocol.

##### 3.6.5.3 Message Processing

If the HTTP status code is 200 or 206, the client MUST continue processing for the current state, as
specified in section 3.6.1.1.

If the HTTP status code is 401 or 407, the client MUST follow the rules defined in [RFC2617] and
[RFC2616] regarding sending the response for the authentication challenge.

For all other HTTP status codes as specified in [RFC2616] section 10, the client MUST return this error
to the higher-layer protocol so that the necessary steps can be taken.

#### 3.6.6 Timer Events

##### 3.6.6.1 Request Timeout

The client MUST cancel the current request, set the state to STATE_SUSPENDED, and send
ERROR_TIMEOUT to the higher-layer protocol.

##### 3.6.6.2 Response Timeout

The client MUST cancel the current request, set the state to STATE_SUSPENDED, and send
ERROR_TIMEOUT to the higher-layer protocol.

#### 3.6.7 Other Local Events

None.

##### 3.6.7.1 Result Found on Peers

When the BITS Peer-Caching: Content Retrieval Protocol client reports RESULT_FOUND ([MS-BPCR]
section 3.1.7.3.2), update the table of cached contents with the returned results, as follows.

  Set RECORD_OFFSET to zero.



Iterate over each range in the cache record:

1.  Set URL_OFFSET and URL_LENGTH to the current range’s offset and length respectively.

2.  For all rows of APPLICATION_RANGES whose offset and length match URL_OFFSET and
URL_LENGTH, update the corresponding rows in the Table of Contents as follows:

  Row.Offset = RECORD_OFFSET

  Row.Source = peer server address

  Row.Record = peer record ID

3.  Increment RECORD_OFFSET by URL_LENGTH.

4.  If the cache record contains another range, then advance to the next range and go to step 1.

If all rows of APPLICATION_RANGE have a non-NULL Source field, then cancel the
FileSearchRequest element in Progress as specified in [MS-BPCR] section 3.1.4.2 and set STATE to
STATE_DOWNLOAD.

<1> Section 2.1: In Windows, the client has the support to handle Basic [RFC2617], digest
[RFC2617], and NTLM and Kerberos [MS-NTHT], [RFC1510], and [RFC4559] authentication challenges
returned by the server. Also, the client has support for client certificate–based authentication and
server certificate–based authentication [RFC2818] for the request entity.

<2> Section 2.2.1: In Windows, the maximum header field size supported on the server is 4
kilobytes.

<3> Section 2.2.1.1: In Windows, the value cannot contain the following characters (in addition to the
characters listed in [RFC2616]): "\ / : * ? " <> |".

<4> Section 2.2.1.2: In Windows, this header is not included in the cases where an explicit HTTP
status code was sent that matches the appropriate error.

<5> Section 2.2.2.1: Only the following Windows versions send the Content-Name header.

  Windows 2000 operating system

  Windows XP

  Windows Server 2003

  Windows Vista (excluding Windows Vista operating system with Service Pack 1 (SP1))

<6> Section 2.2.2.2: In Windows, currently only one supported protocol is used on the client and the
server. This protocol is represented with GUID as {7df0354d-249b-430f-820d-3d2a9bef4931}.
Windows has support on the server to process a maximum of 100 protocols (GUIDs) sent from the
client as the value of this header field.

<7> Section 2.2.3.1: In Windows, the server sends Identity encoding (plaintext) in the current
version of this protocol.

<8> Section 2.2.3.2: In Windows, the server returns the value {7df0354d-249b-430f-820d-
3d2a9bef4931} for this header field.

<9> Section 2.2.4: In Windows, the client sends a PING message after detecting the BITS-Host-ID
header and whenever an interrupted session is resumed.

<10> Section 2.2.6: In Windows where BITS 2.5 is not installed, the maximum block size allowed on
the client is 128 kilobytes. In Windows Vista SP1 and later and Windows 7 and later, or if BITS 2.5 is
installed, the minimum and maximum block sizes allowed on the client are 5 kilobytes and 13
megabytes. If the ACK to a FRAGMENT contains HTTP status 413, the client resends the data in
smaller fragments. The fragment size is not reduced to less than 5 kilobytes.

<11> Section 2.2.6.1: In Windows, the client sends this header as part of each fragment message,
and the server does not use the value of this header.

<12> Section 2.2.6.1: Windows clients always omit this field, and applicable Windows Server releases
support only the identity encoding.

<13> Section 2.2.12.2: In Windows, this limit is imposed on the server application side.

<14> Section 2.2.12.2: In Windows, this limit is imposed on the server application side.

<15> Section 2.3: Windows XP and Windows XP operating system Service Pack 1 (SP1) always send
an initial HTTP/1.1 HEAD request, and future messages use HTTP/1.0 if the server responds with
HTTP/1.0. Other versions of Windows always send HTTP/1.1.

<16> Section 3.1.5.2.4: In Windows where BITS 2.5 is not installed, the maximum block size allowed
on the client is 128 kilobytes. In Windows Vista SP1 and later and Windows 7 and later, or if BITS 2.5
is installed, minimum and maximum block sizes allowed on the client are 5 kilobytes and 13

<18> Section 3.2.1.1: In Windows, this can be set on the IIS virtual directory.

<19> Section 3.2.1.1: In Windows, this is a property of the IIS virtual directory.

<20> Section 3.2.1.4: In Windows, this value is used to send the notification if it has not been sent
already.

<21> Section 3.2.2.1: In Windows, the server sets this value as part of the virtual directory
configuration on the web server.

<22> Section 3.2.4.2: In Windows, the server returns the HTTP status code as 501 and BITS-Error as
x80070005 to the client if the client sends BITS upload messages after BITS uploads are disabled for a
given virtual directory.

<23> Section 3.2.5.2.3: In Windows, the server returns the HTTP status code as 400.

<24> Section 3.2.5.2.4: In Windows, the server creates a file on the server that contains the
uploaded data until all the fragments are successfully received from the client.

<25> Section 3.2.5.2.4: In Windows, if BITSDirectoryConfig has these values populated, the server
sends these as part of the response to the client.

<26> Section 3.2.7:  Windows Server 2003 does not allow the administrator to limit the number of
active sessions for a given user account and the number for a given client certificate.

<27> Section 3.3.5.3.2: In Windows, the server returns multiple errors as BITS-Error and HTTP status
code, depending on the context.

<28> Section 3.6.1: Windows 2000 operating system Service Pack 3 (SP3), Windows 2000 operating
system Service Pack 4 (SP4), Windows XP, and Windows XP SP1 do not support downloads of partial
URL content. They support only a download of the entire URL.

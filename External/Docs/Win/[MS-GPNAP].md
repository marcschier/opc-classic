## 1 Introduction

The Group Policy: Network Access Protection (NAP) Extension protocol specifies functionality to control
client computer access to network resources. Access can be granted or restricted per client computer
based on its identity and its degree of compliance with corporate governance policy. For non-
compliant client computers, NAP specifies automatic methods to reinstate compliance and to
dynamically upgrade access to network resources.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this
specification are informative.

### 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

Active Directory domain: A domain hosted on Active Directory. For more information, see [MS-

ADTS].

certification authority (CA): A third party that issues public key certificates. Certificates serve
to bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide
whether to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be
transitive. For more information, see [RFC3280].

client-side extension GUID (CSE GUID): A GUID  that enables a specific client-side extension
on the Group Policy client to be associated with policy data that is stored in the logical and
physical components of a Group Policy Object (GPO) on the Group Policy server, for that
particular extension.

cryptographic service provider (CSP): A software module that implements cryptographic

functions for calling applications that generates digital signatures. Multiple CSPs can be installed.
A CSP is identified by a name represented by a NULL-terminated Unicode string.

domain: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management

infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller
(DC) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally
hosting the Active Directory service. The domain controller provides authentication of members,
creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its
members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS].

domain controller (DC): The service, running on a server, that implements Active Directory, or
the server hosting this service. The service hosts the data store for objects and interoperates
with other DCs to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across all DCs.
When Active Directory is operating as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), the DC
contains full NC replicas of the configuration naming context (config NC), schema naming
context (schema NC), and one of the domain NCs in its forest. If the AD DS DC is a global
catalog server (GC server), it contains partial NC replicas of the remaining domain NCs in its
forest. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5.2 and [MS-ADTS]. When
Active Directory is operating as Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS),
several AD LDS DCs can run on one server. When Active Directory is operating as AD DS, only
one AD DS DC can run on one server. However, several AD LDS DCs can coexist with one AD
DS DC on one server. The AD LDS DC contains full NC replicas of the config NC and the schema
NC in its forest. The domain controller is the server side of Authentication Protocol Domain
Support [MS-APDS].

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): A protocol that provides a framework for

passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network, as described in [RFC2131].

enforcement client: An enforcement client uses the health state of a computer to request a

certain level of access to a network. For more information about enforcement clients, see
[MSDN-NAP].

globally unique identifier (GUID): A term used interchangeably with universally unique

identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of
these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value.
Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in
[RFC4122] or [C706] have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique
identifier (UUID).

Group Policy: A mechanism that allows the implementer to specify managed configurations for

users and computers in an Active Directory service environment.

Group Policy Object (GPO): A collection of administrator-defined specifications of the policy
settings that can be applied to groups of computers in a domain. Each GPO includes two
elements: an object that resides in the Active Directory for the domain, and a corresponding file
system subdirectory that resides on the sysvol DFS share of the Group Policy server for the
domain.

Group Policy server: A server holding a database of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) that can be
retrieved by other machines. The Group Policy server has to be a domain controller (DC).

health certificate enrollment agent (HCEA): The client-side component in the Health Certificate
Enrollment Protocol. The HCEA is responsible for receiving health certificates from a health
registration authority (HRA). This term can also be used to refer to the client machine in the
Health Certificate Enrollment Protocol.

health registration authority (HRA): The server-side component in the Health Certificate

Enrollment Protocol. The HRA is a registration authority (RA) that requests a health certificate
from a certification authority (CA) upon validation of health.

language code identifier (LCID): A 32-bit number that identifies the user interface human

language dialect or variation that is supported by an application or a client computer.

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The primary access protocol for Active

Directory. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard protocol,
established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which allows users to query and
update information in a directory service (DS), as described in [MS-ADTS]. The Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol can be either version 2 [RFC1777] or version 3 [RFC3377].

Network Access Protection (NAP): A feature of an operating system that provides a platform
for system health-validated access to private networks. NAP provides a way of detecting the
health state of a network client that is attempting to connect to or communicate on a network,
and limiting the access of the network client until the health policy requirements have been met.
NAP is implemented through quarantines and health checks, as specified in [TNC-IF-
TNCCSPBSoH].

object identifier (OID): In the context of a directory service, a number identifying an object
class or attribute. Object identifiers are issued by the ITU and form a hierarchy. An OID is
represented as a dotted decimal string (for example, "1.2.3.4"). For more information on OIDs,
see [X660] and [RFC3280] Appendix A. OIDs are used to uniquely identify certificate templates
available to the certification authority (CA). Within a certificate, OIDs are used to identify
standard extensions, as described in [RFC3280] section 4.2.1.x, as well as non-standard
extensions.

public key: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The public key is distributed
freely and published as part of a digital certificate. For an introduction to this concept, see
[CRYPTO] section 1.8 and [IEEE1363] section 3.1.

Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS): A group of Public Key Cryptography Standards

published by RSA Laboratories.

registry: A local system-defined database in which applications and system components store and
retrieve configuration data. It is a hierarchical data store with lightly typed elements that are
logically stored in tree format. Applications use the registry API to retrieve, modify, or delete
registry data. The data stored in the registry varies according to the version of the operating
system.

statement of health (SoH): A collection of data generated by a system health entity, as specified
in [TNC-IF-TNCCSPBSoH], which defines the health state of a machine. The data is interpreted
by a Health Policy Server, which determines whether the machine is healthy or unhealthy
according to the policies defined by an administrator.

statement of health response (SoHR): A collection of data that represents the evaluation of the

statement of health (SoH) according to network policies, as specified in [TNC-IF-
TNCCSPBSoH].

system health agent (SHA): The client components that make declarations on a specific aspect
of the client health state and generate a statement of health ReportEntry (SoH ReportEntry).

tool extension GUID or administrative plug-in GUID: A GUID defined separately for each of
the user policy settings and computer policy settings that associates a specific administrative
tool plug-in with a set of policy settings that can be stored in a Group Policy Object (GPO).

Unicode: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents

almost all of the written languages of the world. The Unicode standard [UNICODE5.0.0/2007]
provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16
BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

Group Policy: Network Access Protection (NAP) Extension

Release: June 1, 2017


### 1.3 Overview

Network Access Protection (NAP) is a platform that controls access to network resources, based
on a client computer's identity and compliance with corporate governance policy. NAP allows network
administrators to define granular levels of network access, based on who a client is, the groups to
which the client belongs, and the degree to which that client is compliant with corporate governance
policy. Based on the degree of compliance, NAP can implement different enforcement methods that
can restrict or limit client access to the network. If a client is not compliant, NAP provides a
mechanism to automatically bring the client back into compliance and then to dynamically increase its
level of network access. The NAP architecture is specified in [MS-NAPOD].

The behavior of NAP can be controlled through Group Policy by updating the client registry, as
specified in [MS-GPOL] and in [MS-GPREG]. This mechanism can be used by an administrator to
enable or disable NAP enforcement, to set Health Registration Authorities (HRAs) to be used by
the client, and to control client user interface and tracing. All NAP group policies are machine-specific,
meaning that the same policy is applied to all users on a given machine.

#### 1.3.1 Background

The Group Policy: Core Protocol, as specified in [MS-GPOL], allows clients to discover and retrieve
policy settings created by administrators of a domain. These settings are persisted within Group
Policy Objects (GPOs) assigned to policy target accounts, which are either computer accounts or user
accounts in Active Directory. Each client uses the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
to determine which GPOs are applicable to it by consulting the Active Directory objects corresponding
to its computer account and the user accounts of any users that log on to the client computer.

On each client, each GPO is interpreted and acted upon by software components known as client-side
plug-ins. Each client-side plug-in is associated with a specific class of settings. The client-side plug-ins
that are responsible for a given GPO are specified by using an attribute on the GPO. This attribute
specifies a list of GUID pairs. The first GUID of each pair is referred to as a client-side extension
GUID (CSE GUID). The second GUID of each pair is referred to as a tool extension GUID.

For each GPO that is applicable to a client, the client consults the CSE GUIDs listed in the GPO to
determine which client-side plug-ins on the client will handle the GPO. The client then invokes the
client-side plug-ins to handle the GPO. Next, the client-side plug-in uses the contents of the GPO to
retrieve and process settings specific to its class, in a manner specific to the plug-in.

#### 1.3.2 Group Policy Extension Overview

NAP client configuration Group Policy settings are accessible from a GPO through the Group Policy:
NAP Extension to the Group Policy: Core Protocol. The extension provides a mechanism for
administrative tools to obtain metadata about registry-based settings.

The process of configuring and applying the NAP Group Policy settings consists of the following steps:

1.  An administrator invokes a Group Policy administrative tool to administer the NAP client

configuration settings through the Group Policy: NAP Extension. The NAP Extension reads and
updates a generic settings database using the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding, as
specified in [MS-GPREG] section 3.1.5.8, which results in the storage and retrieval of settings on a
Group Policy server. These settings describe configuration parameters to be applied to a generic
settings database on a client that is affected by the GPO.

The administrator views the data and updates it as desired.

2.  A client computer affected by that GPO is started (or is connected to the network, if this happens
after the client starts), and the Group Policy: Core Protocol is invoked by the client to retrieve
Policy Settings from the Group Policy server. As part of this processing, the registry extension's
CSE GUID (as specified in [MS-GPREG] section 1.9) is read from the GPO.

<!-- Extracted images from page 11 -->
![Extracted image 1 from page 11]([MS-GPNAP].images/page011-img01.png)
<!-- /Extracted images from page 11 -->

3.  The presence of the registry extension's CSE GUID (as specified in [MS-GPREG] section 1.9) in the
GPO instructs the client to invoke a registry extension plug-in component for policy application.
This component parses the file of settings and saves them in the generic settings database
(registry) on the local machine.

4.  The NAP subsystem on the client recognizes that its configuration has been updated and takes the

appropriate actions.

This document specifies the behavior of the administrative plug-in mentioned in step 1. The operation
of the Group Policy: Core Protocol in step 2 is specified in [MS-GPOL] section 3.2. The process of
retrieving the settings in step 3 is specified in [MS-GPREG] section 3.2. Step 4 is specific to a NAP
client implementation.

### 1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

Configuration changes updated on the Group Policy server are dependent on the Group Policy:
Registry Extension Encoding, as specified in [MS-GPREG] section 3.1.5.8 (and all protocols specified in
[MS-GPREG] section 1.4), which reads the Group Policy: NAP Extension data structure and updates
the registry.pol file on the Group Policy server.

The distribution of the Group Policy: NAP Extension data structure to the client is dependent on the
Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding, as specified in [MS-GPREG] (and all protocols specified in
[MS-GPREG] section 1.4), which retrieves settings from a GPO and populates those settings in the
client registry.

The Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding as specified in [MS-GPREG] is invoked as an extension
of the Group Policy: Core Protocol, as specified in [MS-GPOL].

### 1.5 Applicability Statement

The Group Policy: NAP Extension is applicable only within the Group Policy framework and is used to
configure certain aspects of NAP behavior on such clients.

The Group Policy: NAP Extension has only an administrative-side extension and no client-side
extension. This extension updates the generic settings database<3> and is documented here for
informative purposes only.

### 1.6 Versioning and Localization

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

  Structure Versions: There is no versioning mechanism in the Group Policy: NAP Extension. If new
functionality is required that would be incompatible with the existing registry settings, a new
Group Policy extension is implemented.



Localization: Localization-dependent registry content is specified in section 2.2.

The Group Policy: NAP client configuration contains registry keys with data that is used for display
purposes; these keys can contain localization-dependent content.

### 1.7 Vendor-Extensible Fields

The Group Policy: NAP Extension does not define any vendor-extensible fields.

This structure defines tool extension GUID values, as specified in [MS-GPOL] section 1.8. The
following assignment represents the GUID in string format.

## 2 Structures

This protocol references commonly used data types as defined in [MS-DTYP]. The NAP Group Policy
administrative plug-in uses the transport specified in [MS-GPOL] to read and modify settings in the
central policy store. Information is retrieved from the policy store by the Group Policy: Registry
Extension Encoding ([MS-GPREG] section 3.2), which writes the information to the client's registry.

The NAP Group Policy client configuration is implemented as a set of entries in the machine-specific
Registry Policy file used by the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding. To support the NAP Group
Policy option, the NAP administrative plug-in MUST be able to write and query the corresponding entry
in the machine-specific Registry Policy file of the relevant GPO.

The following NAP Group Policy client configurations are defined:



Trace settings

  User interface settings



Enforcement client settings

  Health registration authority (HRA) settings

  Statement of health (SoH) settings

The following sections specify the format of the corresponding entries in the machine-specific Registry
Policy file. The intent of various settings is also described in the following sections; however, these
settings are processed by the NAP system in the client, and their descriptions here are only for
informative purposes, not for normative purposes.

### 2.1 Trace Settings

The NAP client tracing functionality settings are compounded from two registry entries that are
represented in the machine-specific Registry Policy file as follows:

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig\

#### 2.1.1 Enable Tracing

of the image data specified in section 2.2.3. File formats, as indicated in the file type extension,
include but are not restricted to bmp, icon, gif, jpeg, exif, png, tiff, wmf, or emf.

### 2.3 Enforcement Client Settings

A NAP enforcement client uses the health state of a computer to request a certain level of access to
a network. This is done using NAP protocol SoH ([TNC-IF-TNCCSPBSoH] section 3.5) and statement
of health response (SoHR) ([TNC-IF-TNCCSPBSoH] section 3.6) messages exchanged between a
client and a server to validate client conformance with corporate security policies.

Different types of mechanisms transport SoHs intended to manage the health of connected resources.
These mechanisms, called enforcement clients, are configured from the NAP Group Policy and are
listed in the following table.

For more information on NAP enforcement clients, see [MSDN-NAP].

The NAP enforcement client settings are compounded from one registry entry per enforcement client
that MUST be represented in the machine-specific Registry Policy file as follows:

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig\Qecs\<qec-id>

All the <qec-id> keys MUST have the following value:

Value: "Enabled" or one of the value names listed in the table in [MS-GPREG] section 3.2.5.1
specifying how the value is deleted.

Type: REG_DWORD.

Size: Equal to size of the Data field.

Data: A 32-bit unsigned integer.

Value

Meaning

0x00000000  Disables NAP enforcement.

0x00000001  Enables NAP enforcement.

#### 2.3.1 DHCP Enforcement

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) NAP enforcement client provides functionality
in the DHCP client service that uses industry standard DHCP messages to exchange system health
messages specified in section 2.3.

The client sends system health information to the DHCP enforcement server, using DHCP Extensions,
as specified in [MS-DHCPN]. The DHCP server can send the SoH to a policy server (for example NPS)
for evaluation. Based on the policy server response, the DHCP enforcement server can provide IP
addressing information that allows the client to connect to other computers, or it can provide IP
addressing information that limits the computers to which the client can connect. Alternatively, the
DHCP enforcement server might not provide IP addressing information.

For more information on DHCP, see [MSDN-DHCP].

#### 2.3.2 Remote Access Enforcement

The remote access NAP enforcement client provides functionality in the Remote Access Service
(RAS) that makes it possible to connect a remote client computer to a network server over a virtual
private network (VPN) and to send health information provided by NAP.

16 / 35

[MS-GPNAP] - v20170601
Group Policy: Network Access Protection (NAP) Extension
Copyright © 2017 Microsoft Corporation
Release: June 1, 2017


When a client attempts to access a network over VPN, the VPN server can request an SoHR response
message ([TNC-IF-TNCCSPBSoH] section 3.6) from the client by sending some PEAP TLV ([MS-PEAP])
messages. If the RAS enforcement client is enabled on the client, it responds with an SoH message, as
specified in [MS-PEAP] section 2.2.8. The RAS server might send the SoH message to a policy server
(for example NPS) for evaluation. Based on the policy server response, the RAS server can create a
VPN connection that enables the client to connect to other computers on the network, or the RAS
server can quarantine the client by limiting the computers to which it can connect using the VPN
connection. Alternatively, the RAS server can reject the client access request.

For more information on RAS clients, see [MSDN-RAS].

#### 2.3.3 IPsec Enforcement

The IPsec NAP enforcement client is a component that obtains an SoH, as specified in section 2.3,
and sends it to a HRA. The protocol used by the client to communicate with the HRA is called the
Health Certificate Enrollment Protocol (HCEP), as specified in [MS-HCEP].

The HCEP request message payload sent by the Health Certificate Enrollment Agent (HCEA) contains a
PKCS #10 certificate request, as specified in [RFC2986], which contains an SoH message ([TNC-IF-
TNCCSPBSoH] section 3.5).

The HRA sends the SoH to a policy server (for example NPS) for evaluation. Based on the policy server
response, the HRA performs the following steps:





If the policy server response is that the client is compliant with corporate health policy, the HRA
requests a certificate authority (CA) to issue a certificate and sends the issued certificate back
to the client.

If the client's health state is not compliant, the HRA can request a certificate from the certificate
authority (CA), with the certificate containing an indication that the client is unhealthy.

In the IPsec scenario, the client is able to connect to a network, but the client does not have a valid
health certificate for communicating on that network until the HCEP message exchange is completed.
If the client is non-compliant, the HRA might not provide a health certificate.

The IPsec NAP enforcement client also interacts with the IPsec components to ensure that the health
certificate is used for IPsec-protected communication.

For more information, see [MSFT-IPSEC] and [MSFT-NAPIPSEC].

The IPsec NAP enforcement client can be configured to use the local predefined IPsec policy rather
than the default IPsec policy. The use local IPsec policy registry entry can be represented in the
machine-specific Registry Policy file as follows:

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig

Value: "PlumbIpsecPolicy" or one of the value names specified in the table in [MS-GPREG] section
3.2.5.1 specifying how the value is deleted.

Type: REG_DWORD.

Size: Equal to size of the Data field.

Data: A 32-bit unsigned integer.

Value

Meaning

0x00000000  Allows the use of domain-based IPsec Group Policy on the client.

0x00000001  Uses the local IPsec policy on the client.

#### 2.3.4 RDG Enforcement

The NAP remote desktop gateway (RDG) enforcement client is a component that obtains the SoH
from NAP as specified in section 2.3 and uses it while the client connects to a remote desktop server.

While attempting to access an RDG server, the remote desktop client (RDC) obtains an SoH, as
specified in section 2.3, and sends it in the TSGU, as specified in [MS-TSGU].

The RDG server MAY send the SoH to a policy server (for example MPS) for evaluation. Based on the
policy server response, the RDG server MAY grant access to the RDC, or the remote desktop server
MAY grant access but deny access to certain machine resources such as hard drives, disks, PnP
devices, and clipboards.<5>

For more information on RDG and NAP, see [MSFT-RDG].

#### 2.3.5 EAP Enforcement

The NAP EAP enforcement client extends the 802.1x supplicant, allows responding to an SoH
Request TLV message with an SoH TLV message, as specified in section 2.3, and sends the response
using an 802.1x supplicant for 802.1x-authenticated connections, as described in [MS-NAPOD].<6>

While attempting to access a LAN or WLAN using an 802.1x connection, the 802.1x supplicant obtains
an SoH as specified in section 2.3 and sends it in PEAP-Type-Length-Value (TLV) extension, as
specified in [MS-PEAP] section 2.2.8. The 802.1x server can send the SoH to a policy server (for
example NPS) for evaluation. Based on the policy server response, the 802.1x server can enable the
client to connect to other computers on the network or can restrict the traffic of the NAP client by
specifying a restricted network that limits access to specific resources on the network, as described in
[MS-NAPOD]. Alternatively, the 802.1x server can reject supplicant access.

### 2.4 Health Registration Authority (HRA) Settings

NAP HRAs are divided into groups that use the same certificate security settings specified in section
2.3.3. The HRA groups are represented in the registry as depicted in the following figure.

#### 2.4.1 PKCS#10 Certificate Settings

The health certificate enrollment agent (HCEA) MUST be configured with the required security
parameters to construct the Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #10 certificate request,
as specified in [MS-HCEP] section 2.2.1.4.

These security parameters are configured in the NAP Group Policy. If the IPsec enforcement client is

#### 2.4.2 HRA Auto-Discovery

HRA groups can be set by group policy or can be discovered automatically by the NAP client using
DNS SRV lookup, as specified in [RFC2782]. A NAP client discovers a suitable HRA at start-up using
the following sequence:

1.  Query SRV records for HRAs in the Active Directory site of the client (for example,

_hra._tcp.<sitename>._sites.<domainname>)

2.  Query SRV records for HRAs in the Active Directory domain of the client (for example,

_hra._tcp.<domainname>)

3.  Query SRV records for HRAs in the DNS domain of the client (for example,

_hra._tcp.<DNSname>)

To enable HRA auto discovery, a registry setting entry MUST be represented in the machine-specific
Registry Policy file as follows:

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig\Enroll\HcsGroups

Value: "EnableDiscovery" or one of the value names specified in the table in [MS-GPREG] section

3.2.5.1 specifying how the value is deleted.

Type: REG_DWORD.

Size: Equal to the size of the Data field.

Data: A 32-bit unsigned integer.

Value

Meaning

0x00000000  Disables HRA auto discovery.

0x00000001  Enables HRA auto discovery.

#### 2.4.3 Use SSL

The HCEP uses HTTP (as specified in [RFC2616]) or HTTP over TLS (as specified in [RFC2818]) as the
transport for its messages. To configure how HCEP connects to the HRA, a registry setting entry MUST
be represented in the machine-specific Registry Policy file as follows:

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig\Enroll\HcsGroups\<Server-

Group>

Value: "AllowNonSSL" or one of the value names specified in the table in [MS-GPREG] section 3.2.5.1

specifying how the value is deleted.

Type: REG_DWORD.

Size: Equal to the size of the Data field.

Data: A 32-bit unsigned integer.

Value

Meaning

0x00000000  Disables SSL.

0x00000001  Enables SSL.

Communication with the HRA is always performed using SSL when HRA auto-discovery is used; see
section 2.4.1.

#### 2.4.4 HRA URLs

Group Policy enables the administrator to configure specific HRA groups by setting the URL. To
configure an HRA URL, a registry entry MUST be represented in the machine-specific Registry Policy
file as follows:

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig\Enroll\HcsGroups\<Server-

Group>\<String>

<String> is the key name of a specific HRA. The Group Policy: NAP Extension uses Url#.

Url# is the string "Url" with the HRA order in the group concatenated to it. The Policy Group can
define 0 to 254 HRAs in a group. If there are no URLs defined and HRA auto-discovery specified in
section 2.4.2 is set to 0 the NAP client won't be able to request a health certificate as specified in
section 2.3.3.

Example: A URL of the first HRA is defined under the registry key
"Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig\Enroll\HcsGroups\MyGroup\Url0".

##### 2.4.4.1 Server

Value: "Server" or one of the value names specified in the table in [MS-GPREG] section 3.2.5.1

specifying how the value is deleted.

Release: June 1, 2017


Type: REG_SZ.

Size: Equal to size of the Data field.

Data: A variable-length null-terminated Unicode string. This setting specifies the HRA URL to

connect to.

##### 2.4.4.2 Order

Value: "Order" or one of the value names specified in the table in [MS-GPREG] section 3.2.5.1

specifying how the value is deleted.

Type: REG_DWORD.

Size: Equal to size of the Data field.

Data: A 32-bit value in the range from 0x00000000 to 0x000000FE, inclusive.

#### 2.4.5 Reconnect Attempts

Group Policy enables the administrator to configure how long the client waits before attempting to
reconnect to an HRA in the event of a connection failure. To configure a blackout interval, a registry
entry MUST be represented in the machine-specific Registry Policy file as follows:

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig\Enroll\HcsGroups\<Server-

Group>

Value: "BlackOutIntervalInMinutes" or one of the value names listed in the table in [MS-GPREG]

section 3.2.5.1 specifying how the value is deleted.

Type: REG_DWORD.

Size: Equal to size of the Data field.

Data: A 32-bit value representing time in minutes. For example, 0x0000000A represents 10 minutes

of blackout.

### 2.5 SoH Settings

SoH specified in [TNC-IF-TNCCSPBSoH] has two settings that an administrator can configure using
Group Policy. These settings are represented in the machine-specific registry as values
ShatimeoutInMsec (section 2.5.1) and BackwardCompatible (section 2.5.2). In case these registry
values are not set by the administrator, the settings are assigned default data by the NAP client. To
configure SoH, registry values ShatimeoutInMsec and BackwardCompatible can be present in the
machine-specific Registry Policy file under the following key:

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig\

#### 2.5.1 Task Timer

A Task Timer is a system health agent (SHA) timeout. A task timer is associated with all function
calls that a SoH client makes to the SHA. The SHA is expected to complete the call within the timeout.
Otherwise, the call is canceled and an error is reported by the SoH client.

Value: "ShatimeoutInMsec" or one of the value names specified in the table in [MS-GPREG] section

3.2.5.1 specifying how the value is deleted.

Type: REG_DWORD.

## 3 Structure Examples

In the following example, an administrator sets up a new domain and attempts to enable NAP DHCP
enforcement on the computers in the domain. The client computers run operating systems that
contain NAP client processes initialized at startup and terminated at shutdown.

First, the administrator installs and configures an operating system on a computer that is intended to
function as the domain controller (DC). After taking the necessary steps to designate the computer
as a DC and creating a user account over the new domain, the administrator restarts the machine and
logs on as the newly created user.

Next, the administrator launches the user interface for the administrative plug-in and sets the DHCP
enforcement to Enabled. This causes the following entry to be written to the machine-specific Registry
Policy file of the relevant GPO.

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig\Qecs\79617

Value: "Enabled".

Type: REG_DWORD.

Size: Equal to the size of the Data field.

Data: 0x00000001.

The administrator then adds client computers to this domain. When a client computer is restarted for
the first time after being added to the domain, it contacts the domain controller (DC) and reads Group
Policy information, as specified in [MS-GPOL]. As part of this process, a machine-specific registry
policy file containing the following items is also downloaded:

  A set of values under the registry key

Software\Policies\Microsoft\NetworkAccessProtection\ClientConfig\Qecs\79617 that indicates that
the NAP client will instruct the DHCP client on the system to send an SoH when requesting the IP
address for the machine, as specified in section 2.3.1.

The Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding on the client parses this file and adds the configuration
information to the machine's registry.

The NAP client process polls the registry and determines that its Group Policy settings have changed.
The NAP process then reads the enforcement values and sets the system DHCP client to send an SoH.

When a user logs on to the computer, the DHCP client requests the NAP agent for an SoH. NAP
invokes the SHA to collect health information and to generate an SoH. The SoH is then sent by the
DHCP client to the policy server.

The following figure represents such a transaction.

<!-- /Extracted images from page 29 -->

Figure 3: DHCP new lease acquisition process

When the SoH is sent, the client requests access to a service and, as a precondition for that access, is
required to prove that it is in good health. When the SoH is received, it is forwarded to an
infrastructure server that evaluates the SoH and returns the response (the SoHR) to the client by
means of the original receiver of the SoH.

Generally, the receipt of an SoHR by the client allows access to the service being requested. When the
health of the client is not good, the SoHR is likely to contain sufficient instructions to allow the client
to seek and receive remedy. After the client is restored to good health, the client can initiate the
protocol again.

## 4 Security

### 4.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

The Group Policy: NAP Extension sets the NAP enforcement policy on the client computer. This policy
consists of HRA URLs and HRA connection transport and certificate security settings, as well as
enforcement enabling. These configurations can also be set by the user through the NAP configuration
UI. Therefore, it is extremely important that an implementation provide a means of protecting the
integrity of the NAP policy against tampering, especially during its transfer from server to client.
Ideally, this implementation-specific security method is provided as part of the transport for the Group
Policy: Core Protocol.

## 1 Introduction

Active Directory Schema Classes contains a list of the objects of type "class" that exist in the Active
Directory schema for Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). Active Directory and all
associated terms and concepts are described in [MS-ADTS].

Note: This document is not intended to stand on its own; it is intended to act as an appendix to the
Active Directory Technical Specification. For details about the Active Directory schema, see [MS-ADTS]
section 3.1.1.2 (Active Directory Schema).

Note: The object definitions in this document are also available for download in LDAP Data
Interchange Format (LDIF) at the following location: [MSFT-ADSCHEMA].

Note: The object definitions in this document contain information about the product in which the
objects were first implemented in the Active Directory schema. Unless otherwise specified, objects
continue to be available in the Active Directory schema in all subsequent versions of the product
according to the list of products in [MS-ADTS] section 1.

## 2 Classes

The following sections specify the classes in the Active Directory schema.

These sections normatively specify the schema definition of each class and version-specific behavior of
those schema definitions (such as when the class was added to the schema). Additionally, as an aid to
the reader some of the sections include informative notes about how the class can be used.

Note: In the following class definitions, "<SchemaNCDN>" is the DN of the schema NC. For more
information, see [MS-ADTS]  section 3.1.1.1.7.

Note: Lines of text in the class definitions that are excessively long have been "folded" in accordance
with [RFC2849]  Note 2.

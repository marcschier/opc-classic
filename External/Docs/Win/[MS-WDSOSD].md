## 1 Introduction

The Windows Deployment Services (WDS) OS Deployment Protocol specifies services exposed by the
WDS server which are used by the clients to deploy an operating system (OS) on a machine. It is a
client/server protocol which uses the Windows Deployment Services Control Protocol to communicate.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

### 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

Active Directory: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses

LDAP as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of
objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related
credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE]. Active Directory is either deployed as
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory
Services (AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD]: Active Directory Protocols
Overview.

Active Directory domain: A domain hosted on Active Directory. For more information, see

[MS-ADTS].

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS): A directory service (DS) implemented by a domain
controller (DC). The DS provides a data store for objects that is distributed across multiple DCs.
The DCs interoperate as peers to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly
across DCs.  AD DS is a deployment of Active Directory [MS-ADTS].

client machine GUID: Each client machine is assigned a unique GUID by the machine

manufacturer and is stored in the SMBIOS of the client machine as per [DMTF-DSP0134].

deployed OS: An operating system (OS) image that has been deployed/installed on the client

machine.

deployment agent: An application on the client machine that communicates with WDS server and

deploys an OS image on the client machine.

deployment agent unattend: Unattended instructions that provide input for all or some steps

performed by the deployment agent. If unattended instructions do not provide input for certain
steps, the deployment agent asks the user for input.

domain: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management

infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller (DC)
and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting
the Active Directory service. The domain controller provides authentication of members,
creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its
members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS].

domain join: A process to configure a machine to join an Active Directory domain and assume the

identity assigned to it by the domain controller.

driver: Software that allows applications to interact with a hardware device by using abstract/high-

level constructs.

driver package: A collection of the files needed to successfully load a driver. This includes the

device information (.inf) file, the catalog file, and all of the binaries that are copied by the .inf
file.  Multiple drivers packaged together for deployment purposes.

Endpoint GUID: Set of relevant services provided by a Service Provider are grouped together and

as a whole identified by a unique Endpoint GUID.

globally unique identifier (GUID): A term used interchangeably with universally unique

identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of
these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value.
Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in
[RFC4122] or [C706] have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique
identifier (UUID).

image group: Each image group has a unique name and an ACL to specify users who are allowed
to deploy OS images from the image group. An image group can contain multiple OS image
containers.

little-endian: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in

the memory location with the lowest address.

machine naming policy: Specifies a naming scheme that is used to generate a name for the

machine.

multicast namespace: Hosts multiple content that are available to clients using multicast

sessions. Identification by a unique name is required. All content under a multicast namespace
is available for transmission over multicast transmission.

multicast transmission: The ability of server to send OS image container files using the multicast

feature of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

OS deployment process: Set of operations that have to be performed by the deployment agent

to prepare and deploy an OS image on client machine. It also includes steps that are performed
by a deployed OS to bring the OS to a functioning state. Each step in the process might require
input from the user.

OS image: Set of files required to deploy/install an Operating System on a machine. Each OS

image is in either Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) or Windows Imaging (WIM) format. Each OS image
also has associated OS image metadata.

OS Image Container: Single or multiple files that contain one or more OS images. Each OS image

is identified by a unique numeric value in an OS image container.

OS Image Language: An OS image supports multiple locales and at deployment time any

supported locale can be chosen for deployment.

OS Image Metadata: Set of attributes that specifies the properties of an OS image.

OS Image Unattend: Unattended instructions that provide input for some or all steps performed

by the Deployed OS to bring OS to a functioning state. If Unattended instructions do not provide
input for certain steps, Deployed OS asks user for input.

Remote Installation (REMINST) Share: A disk share that all WDS servers are required to create

on initialization.

Status Message: Client sends status update messages to WDS server during deployment of an OS

image on client machine. Each status message includes the severity and description.

Unattend Variable: A placeholder in the Unattended Instructions that is replaced by a value

during OS Deployment Process.

Unattended Instructions: Set of instructions that enable Deployment Agent and Deployed OS to

operate in Unattended Mode.

Unattended Mode: Same as Unattended Operation.

Unicode string: A Unicode 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a Unicode 16-bit
string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an ordered
sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a
terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all Unicode strings follow the UTF-16LE
encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

VHD Image: An OS image packaged in the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) format.

WDS server: A Windows Deployment Services (WDS) server that communicates with clients by

using the WDS OS Deployment Protocol to aid in deployment of an OS image on a client
machine. Clients also communicate to a WDS server to request initiation/setup of multicast
sessions for content available in multicast namespace on server.A WDS server provides an
extensible mechanism to allow service providers to provide services to clients.

WIM Image: An OS image packaged in Windows Imaging (WIM) file format.

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

### 1.3 Overview

The deployment agent uses the WDS OS Deployment Protocol (WDSOSD) to request information
concerning deployment of an OS image on the client system. This information includes instructions
for deploying an OS with or without user interaction, available OS images on the server, reporting of
current status of the client, and joining of an Active Directory domain at the end of the deployment
process.

A typical interaction between client and server involves the following steps (for brevity, only the core
steps for OS deployment are included below).

1.  The client has already obtained the name or IP address of the WDS server.

2.  The deployment agent queries the WDS server if it should perform the OS deployment process

in unattended mode, along with unattended instructions for the deployment agent, if
applicable.

3.  The client obtains user credentials and requests the server to enumerate the OS images available

to the client.

4.  Once an OS image is selected, the client proceeds to download the relevant files, and deploys the

OS image on the client machine.

5.  The client queries the server as to whether the client machine is to join an Active Directory

domain, and applies the policy depending on the answer.

6.  The client enumerates all devices installed on the client machine and requests applicable driver

packages from the server, and then proceeds to configure the deployed OS using the driver
package returned by the server.

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The WDS OS Deployment Protocol relies on the Windows Deployment Services Control Protocol as
transport. It uses the WDS Control Protocol to send and receive replies.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship of the WDS OS Deployment Protocol and how it
relates to the WDS Control Protocol.

### 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

This protocol is implemented on top of the WDS Control Protocol, and therefore has the prerequisites
identified in [MS-WDSC].

The WDS OS Deployment Protocol assumes that the client has obtained the name or IP address of the
server that supports this protocol.

The deployment agent supports the OS images available on the server and is responsible for
deploying and installing the OS image from an OS image container to the client machine.

The deployment agent and WDS server have an agreement on the format of the deployment agent
unattend, if applicable.

The WDS server and deployed OS have an agreement on the format of the deployed OS unattend.

The deployment agent can process replacement variables for the deployed OS unattend.

The deployment agent is capable of configuring the deployed OS to join a specific Active Directory
domain, if applicable.

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is applicable when an application deploys an OS on a client machine.

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

  Supported transports: This protocol uses the Windows Deployment Services Control Protocol for

transport as specified in section 2.







Protocol versions: The protocol supports multiple Endpoint GUIDs and opcodes as specified in
section 2.1.

 Security and authentication methods: The security requirements for each Endpoint GUID and
opcode are defined in 2.2.

Localization: The protocol acts as a pass-through for all strings; no support for localization is built
into the protocol.

  Capability negotiation: The protocol does explicit capability negotiation for certain Endpoint GUIDs

and opcodes as specified in the following section.

Capability

Section

WDS_OP_IMG_ENUMERATE  Section 2.2.6

### 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses Win32 error codes as defined in [MS-ERREF] section 2.2. Vendors SHOULD reuse
those values with their indicated meaning. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the
future.

## 3 Protocol Details

### 3.1 Server Details

This section specifies the WDS OS Deployment Protocol behavior for WDS server.

#### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation
maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the
explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations
adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this
document.

image group: Collection of OS images grouped under an image group. Each image group is

identified by a unique name, and access to OS images in the image group is controlled by image
group access control list.

image group access control list: An access control list that specifies which client identities have

read permissions for the image group.

image store: Collection of image groups. All files and folders for image groups and OS images in an

image group are made available by the server using a network share<35>

WDS server configuration: Configuration information for a server, in persistent storage, in the form

of (name, value) pairs. The list of metadata information can be found in section 3.1.1.1.

driver package store: Persistent storage where files and metadata for each driver package is

stored. All files for driver packages are made available by the server using a network share<36>

status messages log: A persistent storage where all status messages received from clients are

stored.

deployment agent unattend store: A persistent storage where unattended instructions for the

deployment agent for each processor architecture are stored.

computers in active directory domain: Configuration information for each client machine is stored

in the Active Directory domain.

users in active directory domain: Configuration information for each user is stored in the Active

Directory domain.

computers in a custom computer data store: Configuration information for each client machine

can be stored in a custom data store remotely on the server machine, or locally on the server
machine, in a format other than the Active Directory domain.

##### 3.1.1.1 WDS Server Configuration

The following properties are stored for the WDS server configuration.

ClientLoggingLevel: A numeric value that specifies the types of status messages the client MUST

log during the OS deployment process.

34 / 58


NewMachinesJoinDomain: A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that all client machines

that do not have a computer object in the Active Directory domain MUST join the Active
Directory domain. A value of False specifies that such client machines MUST NOT join an Active
Directory domain.

NewMachineNamingPolicy: Specifies the naming scheme to use to generate the name for the client

machines (Machine Naming Policy section).

NewMachineOU: Specifies the distinguished name of the organizational unit (OU) in the Active
Directory domain where client machines that do not have a computer object in the Active
Directory domain MUST create the computer object.

PrestageUsingMAC: A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that all client machines that do
not have a computer object in Active Directory domain MUST set the netbootGUID attribute of the
computer object to the MAC address of the network interface card being used by the client to
communicate with the server. When set to False, this value specifies that the client machine
GUID MUST be used for the netbootGUID attribute of the computer object.

ResetBootProgram: A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that the client MUST delete

the value of the netbootMachineFilePath attribute of the computer object. When set to False, the
client MUST NOT take any action.

ImageFilterOnVersion: A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that the client MUST

display OS images where the version of the OS image exactly matches the version of the OS
being used by the client for deployment. When set to False, the client MUST NOT do any filtering
based on versions.

ImageFilterOnFirmware: A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that the client MUST

display OS images where the firmware type of the OS image exactly matches the firmware type of
the client machine. When set to False, the client MUST NOT filter OS images based on firmware
type.

OSImageUnattendOverride: A Boolean value that, when set to True, specifies that the unattended

instructions for the deployed OS present on the client machine MUST override any unattended
instructions for the deployed OS provided by the server. When set to False, the unattended
instructions provided by the server MUST be used.

##### 3.1.1.2 Computers in Active Directory Domain

The server uses the MAC address or the client machine GUID to find the computer object in Active
Directory Domain for each client. The server uses the LDAP search filter as follows to search for the
computer object for the client machine.

(&(objectClass=Computer)(|(netbootGUID=<MAC Address>)(netbootGUID=<client machine
GUID>)))

If more than one matching computer object is found, the server uses the first matching computer
object.

MachineName: Any dollar sign characters at the end of the value for samAccountName attribute are
removed, and the resulting value is used as machine name for the client machine.

netbootMirrorDataFile: This attribute is used to store multiple values in the following format:

<key-1>=<value-1>; <key-2>=<value-2>;...; <key-N>=<value-N>;

DeploymentAgentUnattend: Specifies the relative path to the file containing unattended
instructions for deployment agent. The value is stored in netbootMirrorDataFile attribute using
the WdsUnattendFilePath key. If the key is missing from netbootMirrorDataFile, or the value is

[MS-WDSOSD] - v20240423
Windows Deployment Services Operation System Deployment Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

35 / 58


set to an empty string, then it MUST be treated as if there is no unattended instruction for the
deployment agent.

JoinDomain: Specifies whether the client machine MUST join an Active Directory domain. The value is
stored in the netbootMirrorDataFile attribute using the DomainJoin key. The value is a numeric
value which is set to zero to indicate that the client machine MUST NOT join the Active Directory
domain; a nonzero value indicates that the client machine MUST join the Active Directory domain. If
this key is missing from the netbootMirrorDataFile attribute, it MUST be treated as being set to a
nonzero value.

##### 3.1.1.3 Users in the Active Directory Domain

The server uses the user name of the authenticated user to find the user object in Active Directory
domain. The server uses the following LDAP search filter to find the user account.

(&(objectClass=User)(samAccountName=<User Name>$))

FirstName: The givenName attribute specifies the first name of the user.

LastName: The sn attribute specifies the last name of the user.

##### 3.1.1.4 Machine Naming Policy

The machine naming policy is used to generate a unique name for the client machine so that it can
join an Active Directory domain. A machine naming policy consists of alphanumeric characters, and
has variables embedded in it. The variables are replaced with actual values to generate a unique name
for the client machine.

The following variables MUST be supported.

Variable

Description

%[0][length]First

Replaced with the first name of the user.

%[0][length]Last

Replaced with the last name of the user.

%[0][length]Username  Replaced with the user name of the user.

%[0][length]MAC

Replaced with the MAC address of the network interface card being used by the client
machine to communicate with the WDS server.

%[0][length]#

Replaced with an incremental number.

Variable names MUST be treated as case-insensitive.

The fields inside square brackets [] are optional.

If a percentage (%) character is followed by zero, then a numeric value for length MUST be specified.

The length field specifies the maximum number of characters to be used for the variable value,
counting the characters from left to right. If the length of the value for a variable is larger than the
length specified by the length field, it MUST be trimmed to the length specified by length. If the length
of the value for a variable is smaller than length, then the actual value for the variable is used.

If the percentage (%) character is followed by zero, and the length of the value for a variable is
smaller than the length, then the value MUST be left-padded with zeros to increase the length of value
to length.

If neither zero nor length is specified following the percentage (%) character, then the actual value for
the variable is used.

The client MUST query and send a list of all devices installed on the client machine to the server using
WDS_OP_GET_MACHINE_DRIVER_PACKAGES (section 2.2.7).

For each driver package that is returned by the server, the client MUST configure the deployed OS
to use the driver package.

The client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_DRIVER_PACKAGE_NOT_ACCESSIBLE status message
if the files for the driver package are not accessible, and if LogLevel (section 3.2.1.1) allows it.

The client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_OFFLINE_DRIVER_INJECTION_FAILURE status
message if it encounters a failure configuring the deployed OS for the driver package, and LogLevel
(section 3.2.1.1) allows it.

If LogLevel (section 3.2.1.1) allows logging, the client MUST log a
WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_OFFLINE_DRIVER_INJECTION_END status message.

##### 3.2.5.7 Deployed OS Unattend and Domain Join

If LogLevel (section 3.2.1.1) allows logging, the client MUST log a
WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_POST_ACTIONS_START status message.

The client MUST get domain join information from the server using
WDS_OP_GET_DOMAIN_JOIN_INFORMATION (section 2.2.5).

If the FLAGS variable in the reply packet includes the WdsCliJoinDomain flag, and if
WdsCliFlagsAccountExists is also specified, the client MUST follow the steps in section 3.1.5.5.1 ;
otherwise the client MUST follow steps in section 3.1.5.5.2.

If the client fails to configure the deployed OS to join an Active Directory domain, and if allowed
by LogLevel), the client MUST log a WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_DOMAINJOINERROR2 status message.
If the attempt to log the status message fails, the client MUST log a
WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_DOMAINJOINERROR status message.

The client MUST query the server for unattended instructions for the deployed OS. The WDS OS
Deployment Protocol does not provide a mechanism for obtaining the unattended instructions for the
deployed OS. A contract MUST exist between client and server on how this information is
communicated.

If unattended instructions for the deployed OS exists, the client MUST query for unattend variables
for unattended instructions for the deployed OS, using WDS_OP_GET_UNATTEND_VARIABLES (section
2.2.4), and MUST perform variable replacement for unattended instructions for the deployed OS. The
client MUST also configure the deployed OS to use the unattended instructions.

If LogLevel allows logging, the client MUST log a
WDS_LOG_TYPE_CLIENT_POST_ACTIONS_ENDstatus message.

1  Introduction

This document specifies the Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Data Structures:





The Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Data Structures allow data from one application to be
stored in the document of another application. The first application is called the creating
application and the second application is called the container application. The data itself is
called an embedded object.

The OLE File Format Data Structures also allow a document from one application to reference data
that resides in a different application. The first application is called the container application and
the second application is called the creating application. The data being referenced is called a
linked object.

For example, a user can embed a spreadsheet (which is data that belongs to the spreadsheet
application) in a word-processing document. When the word-processing application displays the
document to the user, it can establish that the spreadsheet data belongs to the spreadsheet
application and the word-processing application can interact with the spreadsheet application to
display the spreadsheet data to the user.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this
specification are informative.

1.1  Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

American National Standards Institute (ANSI) character set: A character set defined by a
code page approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The term "ANSI" as
used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference and a misnomer that persists in the
Windows community. The source of this misnomer stems from the fact that the Windows code
page 1252 was originally based on an ANSI draft, which became International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) Standard 8859-1 [ISO/IEC-8859-1]. In Windows, the ANSI character set
can be any of the following code pages: 1252, 1250, 1251, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256, 1257,
1258, 874, 932, 936, 949, or 950. For example, "ANSI application" is usually a reference to a
non-Unicode or code-page-based application. Therefore, "ANSI character set" is often misused
to refer to one of the character sets defined by a Windows code page that can be used as an
active system code page; for example, character sets defined by code page 1252 or character
sets defined by code page 950. Windows is now based on Unicode, so the use of ANSI character
sets is strongly discouraged unless they are used to interoperate with legacy applications or
legacy data.

class identifier (CLSID): A GUID that identifies a software component; for instance, a DCOM

object class or a COM class.

clipboard: A program provided by the operating system that enables local data transfer between

applications by using the cut, copy, and paste operations.

color matching: The conversion of a color, sent from its original color space, to its visually closest

color in the destination color space. See also Image Color Management (ICM).

container application: An application that creates documents that store reference data from

other applications.

container document: A document that stores or references data from more than one application.

creating application: An application whose data is stored in or referenced by documents from

other applications.

dithering: A form of digital halftoning.

drive letter: One of the 26 alphabetical characters A-Z, in uppercase or lowercase, that is

assigned to a volume. Drive letters serve as a namespace through which data on the volume
can be accessed. A volume with a drive letter can be referred to with the drive letter followed by
a colon (for example, C:).

embedded object: An object that is created by using one application and is hosted in a document
that was created by using another application. Embedding an object, rather than inserting or
pasting it, ensures that the object retains its original format. Users can double-click an
embedded object and edit it with the toolbars and menus from the application that was used to
create it. See also Object Linking and Embedding (OLE).

Image Color Management (ICM): Technology that ensures that a color image, graphic, or text

object is rendered as closely as possible to its original intent on any device despite differences in
imaging technologies and color capabilities between devices.

linked object: An object that is inserted into a document and continues to exist in a separate
source file. If the object in the source file changes, the object in the document is updated
automatically to reflect those changes.

little-endian: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in

the memory location with the lowest address.

native data: The data that constitutes the state of an embedded object. The only entity that can

create and process the data is the creating application.

n-up printing: The act of arranging multiple logical pages on a physical sheet of paper.

path: When referring to a file path on a file system, a hierarchical sequence of folders. When
referring to a connection to a storage device, a connection through which a machine can
communicate with the storage device.

presentation data: Data that is required to display the linked or embedded object within the

container application.

printer driver: The interface component between the operating system and the printer device. It
is responsible for processing the application data into a page description language (PDL) that
can be interpreted by the printer device.

Unicode: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents

almost all of the written languages of the world. The Unicode standard [UNICODE5.0.0/2007]
provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16
BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

Unicode string: A Unicode 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a Unicode 16-bit
string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an ordered
sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a
terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all Unicode strings follow the UTF-16LE
encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

Universal Naming Convention (UNC): A string format that specifies the location of a resource.

For more information, see [MS-DTYP] section 2.2.57.

value: A data element associated with a key.

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

1.3  Overview

The Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Data Structures enable applications to create documents
that contain linked or embedded objects. The file format of an embedded object is different from
that of a linked object because the embedded object is required to contain its native data as well as
data about its creating application. The linked object, however, is required only to contain a
reference to its data. Both embedded and linked objects are required to contain presentation data.

The following sections describe the logical layout of the file formats of embedded and linked objects.

1.3.1  Embedded Objects

The logical layout of a container document that contains an embedded object is shown in the
following figure.

Figure 1: Embedded object container document

The document contains data that is specific to the container application, an identifier of the
creating application, the native data of the embedded object, and the presentation data of the
embedded object. The native data allows the container application to pass the object back to its
creating application for possible changes.

The container application data is private to the container application and is not specified in this
document. The rest of the data that make up the embedded object file format are specified in this
document as follows:

Creating Application Identifier

  When using the OLE1.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the creating application identifier is specified in the

ClassName field of the ObjectHeader structure (section 2.2.4).

  When using the OLE2.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the creating application identifier is specified as

follows:





For embedded objects, the creating application identifier is specified by the object class
globally unique identifier (GUID) contained in the class identifier (CLSID) field of the
Compound File Directory Entry ([MS-CFB] section 2.6.1) of the OLE Compound File Storage
object ([MS-CFB] section 1.3) that contains the OLESTREAM structure (section 2.3.3) that
specifies the embedded object.

For linked objects, the creating application identifier is specified by the object class GUID
contained in the Clsid field of the OLESTREAM structure (section 2.3.3) that specifies the
linked object.

Embedded Object Native Data

  When using the OLE1.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the embedded object native data is specified in

the NativeData field of EmbeddedObject structure (section 2.2.5).

Release: April 23, 2024

  When using the OLE2.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the embedded object native data is specified in

the following two ways, which can be used interchangeably:

  An OLE Compound File Stream object that uses the name "\1Ole10Native" is created within
the OLE Compound File Storage object that corresponds to the linked object or embedded
object. The stream object is used to contain the native data, as specified in the NativeData
field of the OLENativeStream structure (section 2.3.6).

  OLE Compound File Stream objects are created by the creating application within the OLE

Compound File Storage object that corresponds to the linked object or embedded object. The
stream objects are used to contain the native data. Such stream objects are private to the
creating application and are not specified in this document.

Embedded Object Presentation Data

  When using the OLE1.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the embedded object presentation data is

specified in the Presentation field of EmbeddedObject structure (section 2.2.5).

  When using the OLE2.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the embedded object presentation data is

specified in OLE Compound File Stream objects with names that contain the prefix "\2OlePres"
within the OLE Compound File Storage object. The names correspond to the linked object or
embedded object. Each of these streams contains an instance of the OLEPresentationStream
structure (section 2.3.4).

1.3.2  Linked Objects

The logical layout of a container document that contains a linked object is shown in the following
figure:

Figure 2: Linked object container document

The document contains data that is specific to the container application, data that describes the
source file that contains the linked object's native data, and the presentation data for the linked
object. The document does not contain the native data of the linked object.

The container application data is private to the container application and is not specified in this
document. The rest of the data that make up the linked object format are specified in this document
as follows:

Linked File Source Data

  When using the OLE1.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the Linked File Source Data is specified in the
TopicName and the NetworkName fields of the LinkedObject structure (section 2.2.6).

  When using the OLE2.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the Linked File Source Data is specified by the

MonikerStream field of the OLEStream structure (section 2.3.3).

  When using the OLE1.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the linked object presentation data is specified in

the Presentation field of the LinkedObject structure (section 2.2.6).

  When using the OLE2.0 Format (section 1.3.3), the linked object presentation data is specified in

the OLEPresentationStream structure (section 2.3.4).

1.3.3  OLE1.0 and OLE2.0 Formats

There are two different formats for representing linked objects and embedded objects within
container documents. The first format is the OLE1.0 Format. This format predates the OLE
Compound File technology (as specified in [MS-CFB]). When using the OLE1.0 Format, the linked
object and embedded object data is laid out as a sequence of bytes within the container document.
The data structures in section 2.2 specify the format of the data within the byte sequence.

The second format is the OLE2.0 Format. This format uses the OLE Compound File technology (as
specified in [MS-CFB]). When using the OLE2.0 Format, the container application creates an OLE
Compound File Storage object ([MS-CFB] section 1.3) for each linked object or embedded object. The
linked object or embedded object data is contained in this storage in the form of OLE Compound File
Stream objects ([MS-CFB] section 1.3). The data structures in section 2.3 specify the format of the
data contained in the stream objects.

It is required that an application differentiate in advance whether it is processing a file that uses the
OLE1.0 Format or the OLE2.0 Format. This information is local to the application and is not specified in
this document.

It is strongly advised that implementations of this specification use the OLE2.0 Format when creating
container documents. The OLE1.0 Format is specified to allow only for backward-compatible
implementations.

1.3.4  Miscellaneous OLE2.0 Streams

In addition to the OLE2.0 streams mentioned in sections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, a container document can
also include another OLE2.0 stream:

CompObjStream (section 2.3.7).

1.3.5  Clipboard Formats

The users of container applications and creating applications can use the system clipboard to
transfer data between applications. All data copied to a system clipboard has to conform to a format
specification, known as a Clipboard Format. Each Clipboard Format is identified by a unique numeric
format ID.

1.3.5.1  Standard Clipboard Formats

This specification uses a number of Clipboard Formats called the Standard Clipboard Formats. These
are specified in section 2.1.1. A standard Clipboard Format is identified by a numeric ID as specified in
section 2.1.1.

1.4  Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

The OLE2.0 Format uses the OLE Compound File Streams (as specified in [MS-CFB]) to store linked
object and embedded object data in container documents.

1.5  Applicability Statement

The OLE File Format specification is appropriate when creating a single container document that
contains data from multiple applications. It is applicable when one of the applications is the primary
owner of the document and that application will always be asked to process the document first. It is
not applicable if there are no applications with primary ownership of the document.

1.6  Versioning and Localization

There is only one version of the OLE File Format Data Structure. This data structure does not define
locale-specific processes or data.

This document specifies two types of OLE File Formats: the OLE1.0 Format and the OLE2.0 Format.
These two formats are independent and are not differentiated using a versioning mechanism.

1.7  Vendor-Extensible Fields

The Object Linking and Embedding Data Structures use HRESULT error codes.  These values are
taken from the Windows error number space as specified in [MS-ERREF]. Vendors SHOULD<1> reuse
those values with their indicated meaning. Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the
future.

1.7.1  Registered Clipboard Formats

Vendors can create their own Clipboard Formats, called Registered Clipboard Formats. A Registered
Clipboard Format is identified by a string that contains the name of the Clipboard Format (as specified
in section 2.1.1). Vendors can define their own Registered Clipboard Formats provided that the string
that identifies the Registered Clipboard Format is prefixed with the "OleExternal" string literal.

2  Structures

Field types in packet diagrams are defined by the packet diagram and the field descriptions. All of the
fields in packet diagrams use little-endian byte ordering unless otherwise stated. There is no
alignment padding between fields unless otherwise specified.

This protocol uses the following types specified in [MS-DTYP]:

 Type

 Reference

HRESULT

[MS-DTYP] section 2.2.18

LONG

[MS-DTYP] section 2.2.27

FILETIME

[MS-DTYP] section 2.3.3

Data structures in this document make use of ANSI characters. This structure specification does not
mandate the use of any particular ANSI code page.<2>

2.1  Common Data Types

This section describes the structures that are common to both the OLE1.0 Format and the OLE2.0
Format.

2.1.1  Clipboard Formats

Standard Clipboard Formats and Registered Clipboard Formats (see sections 1.3.5.1 and 1.7.1 for
more details) are used to identify presentation data formats.

A standard clipboard format identifier is of type unsigned long.

A registered clipboard format is identified by a LengthPrefixedAnsiString (section 2.1.4) or a
LengthPrefixedUnicodeString (section 2.1.5).

The Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Data Structures: Structure Specification defines the
following standard clipboard format values to be used to identify presentation data formats:

 Name

 Value

 Presentation Data Format

CF_BITMAP

0x00000002  Bitmap16 Object structure (as specified in [MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.1)

CF_METAFILEPICT  0x00000003  Windows metafile (as specified in [MS-WMF] section 1.3.1)

CF_DIB

0x00000008  DeviceIndependentBitmap Object structure (as specified in [MS-WMF] section

2.2.2.9)

CF_ENHMETAFILE

0x0000000E  Enhanced Metafile (as specified in [MS-EMF] section 1.3.1)

In addition, an application or higher level protocol MAY supply registered clipboard formats (section
1.7.1) to identify custom presentation data formats.

2.1.2  CLSID (Packet)

The packet version of the CLSID structure represents a class identifier (CLSID) in a serialized manner.

  Windows 11 operating system

  Windows Server 2025 operating system

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base
(KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior
also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the
product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed
using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the
SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the
product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.7: Windows only uses the values in [MS-ERREF].

<2> Section 2: The Windows implementation of this structure uses the default system code page as
the ANSI code page for this structure. For more information, see [MSDN-CP].

<3> Section 2.1.7: In Windows, this field contains the name of the display or the printer driver as
described in [MSDN-CREATEDC].

<4> Section 2.1.7: In Windows, this field contains the name of the display or the printer driver as
described in [MSDN-CREATEDC].

<5> Section 2.2.1:  Windows will fail processing a PresentationObjectHeader structure with error
CONVERT10_E_OLESTREAM_FMT (as specified in [MS-ERREF]) if the FormatID field is a value other
than 0x00000000 or 0x00000005.

<6> Section 2.2.4:  Windows will fail to process an ObjectHeader structure with error
CONVERT10_E_OLESTREAM_FMT (as specified in [MS-ERREF]) if the FormatId field is a value other
than 0x00000001 or 0x00000002.

<7> Section 2.2.4:  In Windows the ClassName field contains the ProgID (see [MSDN-ProgID]) of a
Component Object Model (COM) component (see [MSDN-COM]) belonging to the creating
application.

<8> Section 2.2.6: In Windows, this field contains values from the OLEUPDATE enumeration as
described in [MSDN-OLEUPDATE].

<9> Section 2.3.3: Windows will fail processing an OLEStream structure with error
DV_E_CLIPFORMAT (as specified in [MS-ERREF]) if the value of the Version field is not 0x02000001.

<10> Section 2.3.3: Windows caches the storage when the bit is set.

<11> Section 2.3.3: In Windows, this field contains values from the OLEUPDATE enumeration as
described in [MSDN-OLEUPDATE].

<12> Section 2.3.3: Windows will fail to process such a structure with error DV_E_CLIPFORMAT (as
specified in [MS-ERREF]) if the value of this field is not 0x02000001.

<13> Section 2.3.3: Windows will fail processing such a structure with the error E_FAIL (as specified
in [MS-ERREF]) if this field contains a value other than the LONG (as specified in section 2.2.27 of
[MS-DTYP]) value -1.

<14> Section 2.3.3.1:  In Windows, the CLSID present in the StreamData field is that of a COM (see
[MSDN-COM]) object that implements the IPersistStream interface (see [MSDN-IPersistStream]) On
receipt, Windows activates the COM object, obtains the IPersistStream interface and calls the Load
method of the interface passing an IStream object reference (see [MSDN-IStream]) that encapsulates
the StreamData field.

<15> Section 2.3.4: Windows will fail to process the structure with the error DV_E_CLIPFORMAT (as
specified in [MS-ERREF]) if the MarkerOrLength field contains 0x0000000.

<16> Section 2.3.4: Windows will fail to process the structure with the error DV_E_CLIPFORMAT (as
specified in [MS-ERREF]) if the MarkerOrLength field contains a value other than 0xffffffff or
0xfffffffe and the value is greater than 0x00000201.

<17> Section 2.3.4: Windows will fail to process the structure with the error DV_E_CLIPFORMAT (as
specified in [MS-ERREF]) if the FormatOrAnsiString field contains the value CF_BITMAP.

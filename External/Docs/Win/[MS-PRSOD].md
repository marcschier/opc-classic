1  Introduction

This document describes the Print Services system (PSS), which supports the use and management of
a distributed print infrastructure. It describes how the Print Services system can be used in
workgroups and domain-based networks, and how print servers and print clients can use the
member protocols of the system to share one or more printers between one or more print clients.

The Print Services system can serve workgroups, where printers are shared among individual clients,
and domain-based networks, where there can be multiple print servers that are deployed in a cluster
configuration, with the print client configuration managed through the Active Directory system. The
differences between these scenarios are described in the protocols in this document.

1.1  Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

access control list (ACL): A list of access control entries (ACEs) that collectively describe the

security rules for authorizing access to some resource; for example, an object or set of objects.

Active Directory: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses

LDAP as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of
objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related
credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE]. Active Directory is either deployed as Active
Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS),
which are both described in [MS-ADOD]: Active Directory Protocols Overview.

authenticated user identity: The principal that is provided by the underlying protocol. See

retrieval of client identity in [MS-RPCE] sections 3.2.3.4.2 and 3.3.3.4.3 for details.

authentication: The ability of one entity to determine the identity of another entity.

branch office print mode: An operating mode in which a print client is able to perform branch
office printing. Every shared printer on a print server can be configured to operate in branch
office print mode.

branch office print remote logging: An operating mode in which a print client logs printing-
related Windows Events on the print server. Branch office print remote logging occurs only
when the print client is in branch office print mode.

cabinet file: A file that has the suffix .cab and that acts as a container for other files. It serves as
a compressed archive for a group of files. For more information, including the format of CAB
files, see [MSDN-CAB].

Common Internet File System (CIFS): The "NT LM 0.12" / NT LAN Manager dialect of the
Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol, as implemented in Windows NT. The CIFS name
originated in the 1990's as part of an attempt to create an Internet standard for SMB, based
upon the then-current Windows NT implementation.

deployed printer connection: A computer connection or user connection as described in [MS-

GPDPC].

device: Any peripheral or part of a computer system that can send or receive data.

domain: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management

infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller (DC)
and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting
the Active Directory service. The domain controller provides authentication of members,
creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its
members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS].

Domain Name System (DNS): A hierarchical, distributed database that contains mappings of
domain names to various types of data, such as IP addresses. DNS enables the location of
computers and services by user-friendly names, and it also enables the discovery of other
information stored in the database.

driver package: A collection of the files needed to successfully load a driver. This includes the

device information (.inf) file, the catalog file, and all of the binaries that are copied by the .inf
file.  Multiple drivers packaged together for deployment purposes.

driver store: A secure location on the local hard disk where the entire driver package is copied.

endpoint: A network-specific address of a remote procedure call (RPC) server process for remote

procedure calls. The actual name and type of the endpoint depends on the RPC protocol
sequence that is being used. For example, for RPC over TCP (RPC Protocol Sequence
ncacn_ip_tcp), an endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For RPC over Server Message Block (RPC
Protocol Sequence ncacn_np), an endpoint might be the name of a named pipe. For more
information, see [C706].

enhanced metafile format (EMF): A file format that supports the device-independent definitions

of images.

enhanced metafile spool format (EMFSPOOL): A format that specifies a structure of enhanced
metafile format (EMF) records used for defining application and device-independent printer
spool files.

Graphics Device Interface (GDI): An API supported on 16-bit and 32-bit versions of the
operating system which supports graphics operations and image manipulation on logical
graphics objects.

Graphics Device Interface, Extended (GDI+): A Windows API, supported on 32-bit and 64-bit

versions of the operating system, that extends GDI to include support for Bezier curves,
gradient brushes, image effects, and EMF+ metafiles.

Group Policy: A mechanism that allows the implementer to specify managed configurations for

users and computers in an Active Directory service environment.

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML): An application of the Standard Generalized Markup
Language (SGML) that uses tags to mark elements in a document, as described in [HTML].

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): An application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative,
hypermedia information systems (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia
files) on the World Wide Web.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): An extension of HTTP that securely encrypts and

decrypts web page requests. In some older protocols, "Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure
Sockets Layer" is still used (Secure Sockets Layer has been deprecated). For more information,
see [SSL3] and [RFC5246].

Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV): In the context of this document, an IHV is a printer

manufacturer, such as Canon or Hewlett-Packard.

Internet Information Services (IIS): The services provided in Windows implementation that
support web server functionality. IIS consists of a collection of standard Internet protocol
servers such as HTTP and FTP in addition to common infrastructures that are used by other
Microsoft Internet protocol servers such as SMTP, NNTP, and so on. IIS has been part of the
Windows operating system in some versions and a separate install package in others. IIS
version 5.0 shipped as part of Windows 2000 operating system, IIS version 5.1 as part of
Windows XP operating system, IIS version 6.0 as part of Windows Server 2003 operating
system, and IIS version 7.0 as part of Windows Vista operating system and Windows Server
2008 operating system.

Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): A standard protocol for printing and for the management of

print jobs and printer settings over the Internet. It is built on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP).

Internet Protocol security (IPsec): A framework of open standards for ensuring private, secure
communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks through the use of cryptographic security
services. IPsec supports network-level peer authentication, data origin authentication, data
integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection.

language monitor: An executable object that provides a communications path between a print

queue and a printer's port monitor. Language monitors add control information to the data
stream, such as commands defined by a Page Description Language (PDL). They are
optional, and are only associated with a particular type of printer if specified in the printer's INF
file.

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The primary access protocol for Active

Directory. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard protocol,
established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which allows users to query and
update information in a directory service (DS), as described in [MS-ADTS]. The Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol can be either version 2 [RFC1777] or version 3 [RFC3377].

metafile: A sequence of record structures that store an image in an application-independent
format. Metafile records contain drawing commands, object definitions, and configuration
settings. When a metafile is processed, the stored image can be rendered on a display, output
to a printer or plotter, stored in memory, or saved to a file or stream.

monitor module: An executable object that provides a communication path between the print

system and the printers on a server.

NetBEUI: NetBIOS Enhanced User Interface. NetBEUI is an enhanced NetBIOS protocol for

network operating systems, originated by IBM for the LAN Manager server and now used with
many other networks.

page description language (PDL): The language for describing the layout and contents of a
printed page. Common examples are PostScript and Printer Control Language (PCL).

port monitor: A plug-in that communicates with a device that is connected to a port. A port

monitor can interact with the device locally, remotely over a network, or through some other
communication channel. The data that passes through a port monitor is in a form that can be
understood by the destination device, such as page description language (PDL).

Portable Document Format (PDF): An Adobe Systems specification for electronic documents

that use the Adobe Acrobat family of servers and readers. PDF-format files have a .pdf file name
extension.

PostScript: A page description language developed by Adobe Systems that is primarily used for

printing documents on laser printers. It is the standard for desktop publishing.

print client: The application or user that is trying to apply an operation on the print system either
by printing a job or by managing the data structures or devices maintained by the print system.

print job: The rendered page description language (PDL) output data sent to a print device for

a particular application or user request.

print processor: A plug-in that runs on the print server and processes print job data before it is

sent to a print device.

print queue: The logical entity to which jobs can be submitted for a particular print device.

Associated with a print queue is a print driver, a user's print configuration in the form of a
DEVMODE structure, and a system print configuration stored in the system registry.

Release: July 29, 2024

print server: A machine that hosts the print system and all its different components.

print spooler: The component is a service that implements the Print Services system on Windows-
based print clients and print servers. The spooler buffers and orders print jobs and converts
print job data to printer-specific formats.

Printer Control Language (PCL): A page description language (PDL) developed by Hewlett

Packard for its laser and ink-jet printers.

printer driver: The interface component between the operating system and the printer device. It
is responsible for processing the application data into a page description language (PDL)
that can be interpreted by the printer device.

printer port: Hardware port that transfers drawing commands to the printer hardware.

registry: A local system-defined database in which applications and system components store and
retrieve configuration data. It is a hierarchical data store with lightly typed elements that are
logically stored in tree format. Applications use the registry API to retrieve, modify, or delete
registry data. The data stored in the registry varies according to the version of the operating
system.

Remote Administration Protocol (RAP): A synchronous request/response protocol, used prior

to the development of the remote procedure call (RPC) protocol, for marshaling and
unmarshaling procedure call input and output arguments into messages and for reliably
transporting messages to and from clients and servers.

remote procedure call (RPC): A communication protocol used primarily between client and

server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime
environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set
of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the
single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message).  For more information, see [C706].

RPC endpoint: A network-specific address of a server process for remote procedure calls (RPCs).
The actual name of the RPC endpoint depends on the RPC protocol sequence being used. For
example, for the NCACN_IP_TCP RPC protocol sequence an RPC endpoint might be TCP port
1025. For more information, see [C706].

security descriptor: A data structure containing the security information associated with a

securable object. A security descriptor identifies an object's owner by its security identifier
(SID). If access control is configured for the object, its security descriptor contains a
discretionary access control list (DACL) with SIDs for the security principals who are allowed or
denied access. Applications use this structure to set and query an object's security status. The
security descriptor is used to guard access to an object as well as to control which type of
auditing takes place when the object is accessed. The security descriptor format is specified in
[MS-DTYP] section 2.4.6; a string representation of security descriptors, called SDDL, is
specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.5.1.

security provider: A pluggable security module that is specified by the protocol layer above the

remote procedure call (RPC) layer, and will cause the RPC layer to use this module to secure
messages in a communication session with the server. The security provider is sometimes
referred to as an authentication service. For more information, see [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

Server Message Block (SMB): A protocol that is used to request file and print services from
server systems over a network. The SMB protocol extends the CIFS protocol with additional
security, file, and disk management support. For more information, see [CIFS] and [MS-SMB].

Server Service: The CIFS file sharing service. The Server Service registers a NetBIOS name with

a suffix byte value of 0x20 and responds to SMB commands.

Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO): An authentication
mechanism that allows Generic Security Services (GSS) peers to determine whether their
credentials support a common set of GSS-API security mechanisms, to negotiate different
options within a given security mechanism or different options from several security
mechanisms, to select a service, and to establish a security context among themselves using
that service. SPNEGO is specified in [RFC4178].

TCP/IP: A set of networking protocols that is widely used on the Internet and provides
communications across interconnected networks of computers with diverse hardware
architectures and various operating systems. It includes standards for how computers
communicate and conventions for connecting networks and routing traffic.

Uniform Resource Locator (URL): A string of characters in a standardized format that identifies

a document or resource on the World Wide Web. The format is as specified in [RFC1738].

universal serial bus (USB): An external bus that supports Plug and Play installation. It allows
devices to be connected and disconnected without shutting down or restarting the computer.

UNIX: A multiuser, multitasking operating system developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1970s. In
this document, the term "UNIX" is used to refer to any derivatives of this operating system.

Web Services on Devices (WSD): A function-discovery protocol used to discover and

communicate certain data structures in a HomeGroup network environment. Implementation
details are specified in [DPWS].

workgroup: A collection of computers that share a name. In the absence of a domain, a
workgroup allows a convenient means for browser clients to limit the scope of a search.

XML Paper Specification (XPS): An XML-based document format. XML Paper Specification

(XPS) specifies the set of conventions for the use of XML and other widely available
technologies to describe the content and appearance of paginated documents. For more
information, see [MSFT-XMLPAPER].

1.3  Overview

This section provides an overview of the concepts needed for understanding this technology:

  Print spoolers



Print spooler services

  Print queues



Printers and print data formats

  Printer drivers and print processors

Familiarity with the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) [MSDN-WindowsGDI] and GDI
Extended (GDI+) [MSDN-GDI+] is also an advantage for understanding this technology.

1.3.1  Print Spoolers

A print spooler that is running on a print client exposes local printing APIs to applications, receives
the print output of an application, and sends it to a shared print queue on a print server. The print
output is either a printer-specific data stream or a generic metafile that can be converted into a
printer-specific format.

A print spooler that is running on a print server shares print queues to expose them to print clients.
The print server is responsible for the conversion of a print client output data stream before the print
spooler buffers the data stream and sends it to a target printer.

On both a print server and a print client, the print spooler manages printer driver components and
other components that help create the application print output and translate metafiles, and enable
applications to obtain metrics and status information about printers.

The Windows implementations of the print client and print server roles are provided by the print
spooler component. Every Windows operating system that can run a print spooler can act as both print
client and print server.<1>

1.3.2  Print Spooler Service

The print spooler service is a service that is running on each computer that participates in the Print
Services system. The print spooler service implements the print client and print server roles, by
enabling each participating system to act as a print client, administrative client, or print server for the
Print Services system.

Implementation of the print client role can include implementation of the print server role in the print
spooler service due to the dual client/server implementation of the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-
RPRN] on most Windows Client operating system versions.<2> If an implementation acts as print
client only, it supports all Print System Remote Protocol methods and can optionally support the Print
System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR].

For the print server role, the print spooler service registers the RPC endpoints for the print protocols
[MS-PAR] [MS-RPRN] [MS-PAN]. The print spooler service also exposes local interfaces that extend
Internet Information Services (IIS) to support the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) [RFC8010]
[RFC8011] and the Web Point-and-Print Protocol [MS-WPRN] if they are configured to support IPP.

For the print client role, the print spooler service can use polling to collect changes that are related to
printers or to print jobs on the server, or the print spooler service can call the Print System Remote
Protocol notification callback functions that are exposed in that protocol's RPC endpoint. Firewall
settings or Windows Group Policy settings can prevent the client from receiving printing notifications.
The Windows behavior is to use polling in such scenarios. Additionally, the print spooler service
exposes local interfaces that are used by client applications to print, obtain print queue status,
administer print queues, or perform other print-specific actions.

1.3.3  Print Queues

A print queue is an abstract component residing on a print server to which print jobs are submitted.
In some component protocol documents, the phrase "print queue" is used interchangeably with the
word "printer". However, in this system overview, "print queue" always refers to the abstract
component, and "printer" refers to the printers.

1.3.4  Printers and Print Data Formats

A printer is a physical device that is provided by an Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV). It
prints content on a variety of mediums and includes both traditional 2D printers and 3D printers,
cutters, and CNC milling devices that collectively are referred to as 3D manufacturing devices and
print physical 3D objects. A printer consumes a data stream that represents a description of a
document to be printed or a model to be printed, in the case of a 3D manufacturing device. The data
format of that data stream is defined or selected by the IHV that designed the printer or the 3D
manufacturing device.

There are several actual standards for these vendor-defined page description languages (PDLs),
which include PostScript [PS-PPD4.3], Portable Document Format (PDF) [ISO-32000-1], Hewlett-
Packard Printer Control Language (PCL), and the XML Paper Specification (XPS) [MSFT-
XMLPAPER]. Other vendor-specific print data formats are also in use.

For applications to use different printer or 3D manufacturing technologies in a uniform manner, the
Windows graphical subsystem abstracts the details of the print data formats. Windows relies on the
services that are provided by printer drivers and print processors to abstract details of data
formats. Data formats can be native PDLs that are sent directly to the device; or the XPS and
metafile formats such as EMF [MS-EMFSPOOL], which are be re-rendered to a PDL before they are
sent to a printer.

Regardless of the data format, all print data streams that are sent from a print client to a print server
are collectively referred to as payloads. Print payloads are sent from a print client to a print server by
using one of the member protocols of the Print Services system.

1.3.5  Printer Drivers and Print Processors

Printer drivers and print processors are printer-specific and implement a set of functions that
Windows calls to perform the following tasks:

  Convert application document or 3D model creation and drawing commands, including drawing of

text or of 3D objects, into one of the data formats that can be processed by the respective printer.





Provide Windows with information about metrics and capabilities of the printer, such as physical
paper or output area dimensions, color capabilities, quality options, paper path options and
duplexing options.

Provide user interface functionality that enables users to configure settings and default behavior
for a printer.

2  Functional Architecture

2.1  Overview

In addition to protocols supporting communication between print clients and print servers, the Print
Services system also supports externally defined system protocols for the Group Policy and Active
Directory systems. The Print Services system uses the local file system services of the print server to
store print jobs and printer drivers. The Print Services system also uses the local registry on the
print server to persist the abstract data model (ADM) of the print server. The Print Services system
has minimal interaction with other components of Windows.

Printers on a managed network are reflected in the Print Services system as print queues on a print
server. Each print queue has an associated printer driver that is used by the Print Services system and
applications to learn about printer capabilities, such as paper formats, color capabilities, and print
quality. The associated printer driver is also responsible for conversion of application commands into a
vendor-defined page description language (PDL) that is used to print a print job on a printer.

Print clients submit print jobs to the print queues. The print queues are managed by a print spooler
component running on the print server that buffers and orders print jobs arriving from many print
clients simultaneously, or jobs arriving at a higher speed than the printers are capable of handling.

2.1.1  System Purpose

Printers are often acquired and deployed in an organization over time, resulting in a mixed
infrastructure that is comprised of many different printers with varying capabilities, such as color
capabilities, paper sizes, resolutions, features, capacities, and 2D or 3D output. Some printers are
intended for heavy use by large groups of users, while others are intended for lighter use by smaller
groups.

The Print Services system standardizes access and maintenance of multiple printers in a network,
workgroup, or home environment so administrators can more easily deploy and maintain printers,
and so users can choose the best printer for a given job from among a pool of shared printers.

Figure 9: Print Services system internal system architecture

The Windows print client and Windows administrative client are shown in the preceding diagram as a
single client object, contained by a bolded rectangle. Although they are often separate entities, these
clients can share many of the same components and are differentiated by whether a client application
or the Print Management Console, an administrative application under a user account belonging to the
Administrators group, is running.

Within the print client, the Group Policy Service component (GPDPC Service) retrieves Group Policy
settings that restrict print client connections to specified print servers. The GPDPC Service also creates
print queue connections per computer and per user.

To locate a print queue in a workgroup environment, the print spooler of the print client uses the
local computer browser service component, which continually listens for print server announcement
messages. In a domain environment, the print spooler of the print client can locate a print queue by
various means; it can, for example, access an LDAP server of the Active Directory system. The print
spooler then sends a print job to the print spooler that is installed on the print server.

[MS-PRSOD] - v20240729
Print Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: July 29, 2024

The core protocols of the Print Services system are the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN],
Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR], and Print System Asynchronous Notification
Protocol [MS-PAN]. The print server contains a print spooler that receives communications from the
print client's print spooler by using these protocols.

For print clients that do not use the core protocols, the following three Server Service components
provide print server support:







The file server service, using SMB/RAP [MS-SMB] [MS-RAP], provides support for the Windows 95
operating system, Windows 98 operating system, and Windows Millennium Edition operating
system print clients and for users who are running deprecated print commands.

The LPD server service, using the Line Printer Daemon Protocol [RFC1179], provides support for
UNIX-based print clients.

The Internet Information Server Service, using IPP [RFC8010] [RFC8011] and the Web Point-and-
Print Protocol [MS-WPRN], provides support for print clients when the print server is behind a
firewall that prevents communications through the core protocols.

In a domain environment, the print server's print spooler publishes shared print queues, which
correspond to shared printers, to an LDAP server of the Active Directory system. In a workgroup
environment, the print server's print spooler finds other print servers by using the local computer
browser service. The print spooler uses the core protocols to announce shared print queues to each
print server's local computer browser service.

The print server's print spooler persists system data in a registry component. The print spooler loads
print driver, port monitor, print processor, and language monitor modules by using the local file
system. The print spooler also uses the local file system of the print server to buffer print jobs.

2.1.2.5  Windows Printing Architecture

Applications that are built by using Windows interfaces can use device-independent functions for
creating print jobs and sending them to many types of printers. This device independence is based
on the Windows architecture that is provided by the Windows graphics subsystems and the print
spoolers and printer drivers. Print spoolers and printer drivers are replaceable and can be written to
target-specific client and printer hardware, while enabling applications to continue to use stable
interfaces.

2.1.2.5.1 Print Client Communication with Print Server

Applications that are written by using the Windows Print API that are running on print clients access
the local print spooler, which then redirects the application requests to the print services that are
provided by the print server. This redirection establishes a level of indirection that isolates applications
from protocol and capabilities negotiation and other complexities of the protocol, and keeps
application code portable across multiple versions of the Print Services system.

The print spooler that resides on the print server implements print queues. These print queues are
associated with printer drivers, printer ports, and the printers to which they route print data. The
following diagram shows print clients that request print servers to perform a variety of functions.

2.1.2.5.2 Protocols Supporting Different Print Clients

Different Print Services system protocols and other protocols are used to enable a variety of print
clients to communicate with a print server. For more information about the versions, capabilities, and
protocol support are described in section 2.6.

The following diagram shows the various protocols that print clients use to communicate with a print
server.

Figure 11: Protocols used by different print clients

2.1.2.5.3 Protocol Redirectors on Print Servers

Simultaneous server-side support for printing services and file access services by way of the SMB
Access Protocols [MS-SMB] [MS-SMB2] and RAP [MS-RAP] require that redirector components be
implemented on the server because each of these protocols exhibits print-specific and file access-
specific functionality on a single protocol endpoint. In addition, there is no ADM common to all the
print services and file access services.

<!-- /Extracted images from page 26 -->

These redirector components transparently route file access-specific requests to local calls to the file
access services, and they translate print-specific requests to local calls to the print spooler
component that is implementing the print server role. The redirector components then translate the
results of these local calls back to the appropriate protocol response.

The following diagram shows redirectors routing data from a print client to a print spooler.

Figure 12: Redirectors routing data from a print client to the print spooler

2.1.2.5.4 Enabling Print Queues to Be Discoverable

To enable print queues to be discoverable by print clients, the Print Services system uses the
Active Directory system [MS-ADOD] to store and provide information about shared queues.
Although a print client can contact a print server directly to discover the print queues on the print
server, using the Active Directory system that is implemented on the LDAP server enables a print
client to enumerate print queues on multiple print servers. Additionally, the Active Directory system
isolates print clients from the requirement to locate print servers in the domain.

Print clients can request that print servers publish print queues to the Active Directory system through
the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN] and the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol
[MS-PAR]. Print clients can then search for print queues in the Active Directory system by using LDAP.
The details of the interactions between the Print Services system and the Active Directory system are
described in [MS-RPRN] section 2.3. Print clients search the Active Directory system by using the
mechanism described in [MS-RPRN] section 2.3.3.3.

The following diagram shows the LDAP server obtaining information about print queues.

2.1.2.6  Translating Application Content to a Print Data Format

Windows works with the print spooler to manage the translation of application content to printer-
specific data formats by using two configurations, as shown in the following sections. The print spooler
determines the data format for the print job by using the mechanism described in [MS-RPRN] section
3.1.4.9.1.

In one configuration, Windows loads the printer driver directly into the application process. When the
application prints, the produced data stream is already converted to the printer-specific data format in
the application process, and is then passed to the print spooler service for buffering and further
processing. This configuration is independent of the actual produced data format, and is referred to as
producing a raw data format.

In another configuration, Windows does not load the printer driver into the application process, which
isolates the application from the actual translation work. Instead, Windows records document creation
and drawing commands in a metafile, which is then passed to the print spooler service for buffering
and conversion to a printer-specific data format. The metafile can have various data formats, such as
EMF [MS-EMFSPOOL] or XPS [MSFT-XMLPAPER]. The print spooler service uses a print processor,
which is usually part of the printer driver, to assist in the translation of the metafile to the printer-
specific data stream. A print processor loads the metafile and replays the contained commands to the
printer driver, which then performs the actual translation process to the printer-specific data stream.

2.1.2.7  Supporting Client-Side Rendering and Server-Side Rendering

Client-side rendering is one configuration of a client-server printing model. In this configuration, the
print spooler service on the print client translates the metafile to the printer-specific raw format
before sending it as a data-stream payload to the print spooler service on the print server.

In a server-side rendering configuration, the print spooler service on the print client sends an
unmodified metafile payload to the print spooler service on the print server, where the metafile is
subsequently converted to the printer-specific raw data format.

In order to support both client-side rendering and server-side rendering, it is a requirement that print
processors and printer drivers are available to print servers and print clients. Windows addresses
this requirement by using a mechanism called Point-and-Print, which allows a print client to download

27 / 104

[MS-PRSOD] - v20240729
Print Services Protocols Overview

Release: July 29, 2024

a printer driver directly from a print server, and a Package Point-and-Print mechanism that allows a
print client to download a printer support package that includes the print processor [MS-WPRN].

2.1.2.8  Sending Print Data to a Printer via a Port Monitor

In order to send print data to a printer, a print server uses a port monitor module. Port monitors
implement an abstraction API that allows the print spooler service to send and receive data through
a printer port, such as USB or parallel ports on the computer acting as the print server and
connected to a printer, or through a network connection to a printer, such as TCP/IP.

2.1.2.9  Branch Office Print Mode

An operating mode in which a print client is able to print directly to a print device instead of a print
queue on a print server. It can reduce network costs in environments with centralized print servers.
This mode is enabled by an administrator and is transparent to the user. Only print queues connected
via the TCPMON monitor module ([MS-RPRN] section 3.1.4.11.3), the WSDMON monitor module
([MS-RPRN] section 3.1.4.11.4), or the APMON monitor module ([MS-RPRN] section 3.1.4.11.5) are
eligible to operate in branch office print mode.

2.1.3  Applicability

The Print Services system supports the use and management of a distributed print infrastructure. By
using print servers and print clients that implement the member protocols that are described in this
overview, one or more printers can be shared between one or more print clients.

The Print Services system scales from workgroup use, in which printers are shared between
computers, to domain-based networks, in which multiple print servers are employed in a cluster
configuration, and the print client configuration is managed by the Active Directory system. The
Print Services system also provides a subset of functionality for managing a single printer that is
connected to a single computer.

In addition to protocols supporting communication between print clients and print servers, the Print
Services system also supports externally defined system protocols for the Group Policy system and the
Active Directory system. The Print Services system uses the local file system services of the print
server to store print jobs and printer drivers. The Print Services system also uses the local registry
on the print server to persist the ADM of the print server. The Print Services system has minimal
interaction with other components of Windows.

Managed printers are reflected in the Print Services system as print queues on a print server. Each
print queue has an associated printer driver that is used by the Print Services system and applications
to learn about printer capabilities, such as paper formats, color capabilities, and print quality. The
associated printer driver is also responsible for conversion of application commands into the vendor-
defined page description language (PDL) that is used to print a job on a printer.

2.2  Protocol Summary

The member protocols of the Print Services system include the protocols that are described in this
section, IPP [RFC8011] [RFC8010], and the Line Printer Daemon Protocol [RFC1179]. The Print
Services system uses the print data formats of XPS [MSFT-XMLPAPER] and EMFSPOOL [MS-
EMFSPOOL].

The following table provides a comprehensive list of the member protocols of the Print Services

Notification Protocol
Specification

This protocol supports synchronous printing and spooling
operations between a client and server, including print job
control and Print Services system management. This protocol
also provides status notifications, which are defined by the Print
Services system, to the print client. An enhanced replacement for
this protocol is the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol
[MS-PAR].

This protocol supports printing and spooling operations between a
client and server, including print job control and Print Services
system management. This protocol also provides status
notifications, which are defined by the Print Services system, to
the print client. This protocol is designed to be used
asynchronously by print clients whose implementations enable
them to continue execution without waiting for a remote
procedure call (RPC) method call to return. This protocol is an
enhanced replacement for the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-
RPRN].

This protocol is used by print clients asynchronously to receive
print status notifications from a print server and to send back
responses to those notifications. A set of notifications and
responses are defined together as a notification type. In contrast
to the status notification capabilities that are included in the Print
System Remote Protocol and the Print System Asynchronous
Remote Protocol, the RPC interfaces and methods that are
defined by this protocol provide a transport mechanism for
arbitrary, IHV-extensible notification types. This protocol is used
by IHV-provided components that are running on the print server
to trigger the display of a user interface on the print client.

These protocols are used in the Print Services system for
communication with legacy Windows print clients and print
servers to submit print job information. "Legacy" is collectively
used for those print clients and print servers that do not support
the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol. This group of
protocols is used by command-line-based copy to printer share
operations.

Extension

This protocol supports managing connections to printers that are
hosted by print servers and shared by multiple users. The print
server component of this protocol enables an administrator to
configure printer connections. The print client component of this
protocol enables a user to discover the printer connections that
have been configured.

[MS-GPDPC]

The protocols that are used by the Print Services system perform roles as follows:

Printing: The Print System protocols and the SMB access protocols are used for this role.

Managing print jobs: The Print System protocols are used for this role. RAP is used for this role for
print clients and print servers that do not support the Print System protocols.

Managing the Print Services System: The Print System protocols are used for this role. RAP is
used for this role for print clients and print servers that do not support the Print System protocols.

Receive notifications about general printing status: The Print System protocols are used for this
role.

Receive notifications about specific printing status from IHV-defined components: The Print
System Asynchronous Notification Protocol is used for this role.

Respond to notifications about specific printing status to IHV-defined components: The Print
System Asynchronous Remote Protocol is used for this role.

Download printer drivers to a client: The SMB access protocols and Web Point-and-Print Protocol,
based on HTTP, are used to download printer drivers from a website, a printer, or a print server in the
same network as the print client.

Store print jobs: The EMFSPOOL protocol and XPS are used as payloads for print jobs.

Configure print clients: The Group Policy: Deployed Printer Connections Extension [MS-GPDPC] is
used for this role.

The following tables show the member protocols of the Print Services system. They are grouped
according to their primary purpose.

2.3  Environment

The following sections identify the context in which the system exists. This includes the systems that
use the interfaces provided by this system of protocols, other systems that depend on this system,
and, as appropriate, how components of the system communicate.

2.3.1  Dependencies on This System

None.

2.3.2  Dependencies on Other Systems/Components

The Print Services system member protocols require the following protocols:

SMB access protocols:

  Used as transport for the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN]. It uses RPC over named

SMB pipes.

  Used for driver download from a print server by using the copy file functionality of the SMB

access protocols.

RAP [MS-RAP], used to browse for printers.

CIFS [MS-CIFS], used to copy drivers from the server and to submit print jobs over redirected ports.

SMB Version 1.0 [MS-SMB] and RAP. SMB Protocol Versions 2 and 3 [MS-SMB2], however, are not
compatible with RAP:

  Used for managing SMB print scenarios by using RAP.

  Used for managing SMB file copy functionality of the print server by using RAP.

HTTP/HTTPS:

  Used as transport for the Web Point-and-Print Protocol [MS-WPRN].

  Used as transport for IPP [RFC8010] [RFC8011].

RPC over TCP/IP:

  Used as transport for the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR].

  Used as transport for the Print System Asynchronous Notification Protocol [MS-PAN].

Group Policy: Core Protocol [MS-GPOL] [MS-NRPC] [MS-DRSR].

  Used for the Group Policy: Deployed Printer Connections Extension [MS-GPDPC].

  Used for publishing and query of shared print queues.

  Used by the Group Policy: Deployed Printer Connections Extension.

TCP/IP:

  Used as transport by LDAP [RFC4511].

  Used as transport by the Line Printer Daemon Protocol [RFC1179].

  Used as transport by HTTP.

  Used as transport by HTTPS.

  Used as transport by RPC over TCP/IP.

  Used as transport by the SMB protocol family unless on an IPX or NetBEUI network

[NETBEUI].

Common Internet File System (CIFS) Browser Protocol [MS-BRWS].

  Used for workgroup preconditions.

The Print Services system member protocols [MS-RPRN], [MS-PAR], and [MS-PAN] are RPC-based and
require RPC bindings between print servers and print clients to registered RPC endpoints. If a print
client or print server is unable to register an RPC endpoint or create RPC bindings, then Print
Services, which are provided by the local print spooler, only enable the management and use of locally
connected printers. Firewalls that are implemented on print clients or print servers are configured so
that all ports that are required by member protocols are open for RPC-based communication, or at
least open for SMB-based communication to support the Internet printing scenario by using IPP and
the Web Point-and-Print Protocol.

The Print Services system can run in a domain-based network and a workgroup environment. Print
Services require that File Share services be installed and enabled for Point-and Print-driver download
and for SMB and Remote Administration Protocol support. On creation of a printer queue connection to
a print server, the print client tries to copy the driver from the print server. For more information, see
the use cases in sections 2.5.3.3 and 2.5.3.4. If copying the print driver fails, the print client tries, in
turn, to locate:

  Any available implementation-specific driver sources or repositories.<4>



The print client prompts the user to supply an appropriate printer driver from a disk, an Internet
location, or other media.

If the print client cannot obtain a suitable printer driver from any of these sources, the print queue
connection cannot be created.

The Print Services system requires the CIFS Browser Protocol for workgroups. Availability of this
protocol and the Active Directory system is not determined at startup, but only on request. If
neither the CIFS Browser Protocol nor the Active Directory system are available, a print client does not
list any available shared print queues in the network; as a result, only local functionality of the print
spooler is available unless the user of the print client knows the name of the print server and enters
it manually.

The Print Services system uses the Windows Update Services: Client Server Protocol [MS-WUSP], if
available, to find the most up-to-date or best matching printer drivers for a print queue connection. If
Windows Update Services are unavailable, the Print Services system use other methods to find an
appropriate printer driver. For more information, see the use cases in sections 2.5.3.2 and 2.5.3.3.

All member protocols can be used between print clients and print servers, depending on
circumstances.

Print Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: July 29, 2024

The Print Services system uses the Active Directory system in domain-based networks. The LDAP
protocol is used between the print server and the Active Directory system and between the print client
and the Active Directory system. In workgroup environments, the CIFS Browser Protocol [MS-BRWS]
is used for communication between print clients and print servers, and between print servers.

The file system access that is used by clients to download printer drivers only assumes a directory-
structured file system. The print server generally restricts access by using access control lists
(ACLs), so that print clients have only read access to the printer driver files. The file system supports
file date/time stamps for comparing driver versions.

Any number of print servers and print clients can be operated in a domain-based network. The
number of shared print queues of which clients retain knowledge in a Windows workgroup is limited to
an implementation-defined maximum,<5> which limits the useful number of shared printers in a
Windows workgroup network. From the system perspective, the entirety of print clients and print
servers in a given network represents a single instance of the system.

The Print Services system also depends on the following components and infrastructure:









The Windows Authentication Services system [MS-AUTHSOD].

The Active Directory system in a domain environment: If the Print Services system is deployed
within a domain, print servers can publish shared printers to the Active Directory system by using
LDAP. Print clients that are joined to domains also require access to the Active Directory system to
discover published printers.

The networking system to connect print server, print clients, and the Active Directory system.

Printers.

  Application software that provides printing functionality, such as Microsoft Office Word.

The Print Services system is influenced by the following:







The Active Directory system can propagate policy settings that control local spooler behavior to
print clients and print servers.<6> by using the Group Policy: Core Protocol [MS-GPOL].

These policies control aspects of print spooler implementation, for example, which print servers
are considered trusted for printer driver download in Point-and-Print scenarios.

The Group Policy: Deployed Printer Connection Extension [MS-GPDPC] influences the Print
Services system in regard to deployed printer connections.

2.4  Assumptions and Preconditions

The following assumptions and preconditions are necessary for the Print Services system to operate
successfully:

  A network is available to provide a viable transport for the communication between the server and

its clients.









The transport protocol for that network is available and configured. For example, the TCP
transport is configured with a valid IP address.

 Security providers are available to the system to provide message authentication and security.

The durable storage devices that are used to store the system's state are on all participating
computers.

The print spooler service is in the running state on the server and each of the clients
participating in the interaction.



The print spooler is installed on all the participating computers.

The local print client connecting to a remote print server supports impersonation if the remote
spooler requires authentication.

The remote print spooler is not required to use impersonation, nor does it require that local clients
support impersonation, except when using the Print Asynchronous Notification Protocol [MS-PAN].

The file SMB Protocol Family support server service is in the running state on the server.

The print client and print server support the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN].

The system is configured so that participants can access its services locally or remotely.

It is assumed that each participant is trusted by the system.

If member protocols that are supported by the system, as listed in section 2.2, have additional
assumptions and preconditions for when that protocol is in use, see the relevant member protocol
specification for details.



Print servers have a durable store to place the following objects in:

  Printer drivers

  Print jobs



Print clients have a durable store to place the following objects in:



Printer drivers





Print clients and print servers have access to local storage to persist ADM and state information; in
the Windows, this local storage is in the registry.

In a domain configuration, print clients and print servers have access to the Active Directory
system that is provided by the domain.

  Authentication services supporting Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism

(SPNEGO) [MS-SPNG] are available to the print servers and clients.







The Print System Remote Protocol is a RPC interface and therefore has the prerequisites common
to RPC interfaces ([MS-RPCE] section 1.5).

The Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR] is an RPC interface and therefore has
the prerequisites common to RPC interfaces.

The Print Asynchronous Notification Protocol is an RPC interface and therefore has the
prerequisites common to RPC interfaces.

The print client has obtained the name of the print server that supports the Print Services system.
Various protocols can be used, including the Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services
Schema [MS-ADLS], Active Directory Schema Classes [MS-ADSC], and the CIFS Browser Protocol
[MS-BRWS].

2.5  Use Cases

The Print Services system is designed to support scenarios that allow users shared access to printers
that are connected to print servers or to computers that are used by other users. When a user wants
to print to a shared printer, the system facilitates this action by providing the following:



Lists of shared printers

[MS-PRSOD] - v20240729
Print Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: July 29, 2024

35 / 104

  Connecting the user to the print queue that is associated with the requested printer and enabling

the user to install the appropriate printer driver





Transporting the print data from the print client to the print queue

Processing multiple print jobs in the order of their arrival or priorities

  Keeping the user apprised of the status of the print job

The Print Services system also facilitates the management of a large number of shared printers across
multiple print servers by enabling an administrator to remotely install and configure shared print
queues on print servers, to manage the use of shared print queues on print servers, and to view and
manage print jobs that have been submitted by all users to shared print queues on print servers.

Although there is a distinction between the roles and capabilities of administrator and user when
participating in the Print Services system, both roles can be conducted on the same computer. And
although there is a distinction between a print client and a print server as actors in scenarios that are
using the Print Services system, a print client can assume the role of a print server if it enables other
print clients to discover and use a print queue that is installed on the print client computer or
administers administrative clients.

This section provides the use cases that describe the functionality of the Print Services system in
terms of actors that participate in this system and their goals. The use case participants most often
include a print client and a print server. They are triggered by a user performing print operations, or
an administrator performing administrative operations.

Section 2.5.2 provides a table that summarizes the use cases that are described in section 2.5.3.

2.5.1  Actors

Print client: The print client connects to a print queue on a print server, sends print data to the print
queue, displays notifications about the printer or print job, and disconnects from the print queue. The
print client can take the form of an application that the user is printing from or take the form of a
component of an operating system.

Administrative client: The administrative client connects to print servers to establish, configure, and
manage print queues that are hosted on the print servers. The administrative client can also be used
to manage print jobs that are sent to the print queues. The administrative client takes the form of an
administrative tool application.

Print server: The print server hosts print queues, each print queue corresponding to a shared
printer. The print server stores and uses printer drivers that are necessary for processing print data
before it is sent to printers. Depending on the configuration of the print server and print client, the
print server can supply printer drivers to print clients, so print clients can perform print data
processing locally. The print server processes requests from print clients and the administrative
clients. Among these are requests to connect, disconnect, upload a driver, download a driver, and
route print data. The print server manages access from users and administrators to the print queues,
sends notifications about print queues and print jobs to users and administrators, and routes print
data to the appropriate print queues.

Internet browser: An Internet browser can be used to discover shared print queues on a print
server. The internet server component on the print server uses local print spooler APIs to obtain a
list of print queues and presents the list to the client as an HTML page. An Internet browser can be
used for this purpose if a firewall or other network restrictions do not allow the core Print Services
system protocols to be used. When a user knows the name of the print queue, the user can enter the
address in the print client user interface to connect to the printer.

User: The individual who uses a print client to choose a print queue from a list of available shared
print queues, sends a print job to the print queue, and monitors the progress of the print job.

[MS-PRSOD] - v20240729
Print Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: July 29, 2024

Administrator: The individual who is responsible for installing and configuring printers within a
deployed Print Services system, and for monitoring, managing, and troubleshooting printing functions.
The administrator uses an administrative client.

Active Directory system: The Active Directory system is used to store a list of shared print queues
in a domain environment. The Print Services system uses version 3 of LDAP [RFC4511] to publish
information about shared print queues to the Active Directory system. Print clients can then discover
shared print queues that are published by the Active Directory system, which enables a user to choose
a print queue to which to send a print job.

Group Policy system: The Print Services system makes use of the Group Policy system [MS-GPOD]
to restrict print clients from accessing specified print servers and to remotely push preconfigured print
queue connections to print clients. The Print Services system uses a Group Policy Services Extension
[MS-GPDPC] to distribute these preconfigured print queue connections to print clients.

2.5.3  Use Case Descriptions

2.5.3.1  Provision a Print Queue -- Administrative Client

Goal: To make a print queue available on a print server, subsequently allowing a user to select the
print queue, establishing all attributes and components necessary to make the print queue
discoverable and accessible to a print client.

Context of Use: Prior to a user being able to select a shared print queue to which to send a print
job, an administrator is required to use an administrative tool to create and share a print queue on a
print server. In Windows, this tool is the Print Management console. This shared print queue
corresponds to a printer. In addition to creating the print queue, attributes and components of the
print queue are defined, such as the port, to which the printer is connected, and the printer driver
and print processor components that convert the print job data to drawing commands that the
printer uses. After an administrator provisions the print queue with the necessary information, a user
by using a print client, can send a print job to the printer via an application or the operating system.

Direct Actor: The direct actor is the administrative client.

Primary Actor: The primary actor is an administrator.

Supporting Actors: The supporting actors are the print server and the Active Directory system.

Stakeholders and Interests:

  Administrative client: The administrative client is used by an administrator to participate in this

use case to add the necessary information to a print server for allowing a printer to be shared by
multiple print clients.

  Administrator: An administrator participates in this use case by using an administrative client to

configure a print server to share a printer among multiple users.



Print server: A print server is configured by this use case so that a printer connected to the print
server can be shared among multiple users via a queue located on the print server.

  Active Directory system: The Active Directory system is updated by this use case so that a listing
of the print queue is available via a print client when a user attempts to locate a print queue to
which to send a print job.

Preconditions: The print server and the administrative client are connected by using a network
connection, and both are members of the domain. The print spooler service is operational on the
print server and the administrative client. The Active Directory system is available and operational.

Minimal Guarantee: The administrative client is denied access, and no provisioning operations occur.

Success Guarantee: A print queue corresponding to a printer is established on a print server, and
the Active Directory system is updated so that multiple print clients can locate and share the printer.

Trigger: An administrator initiates the process of provisioning a print queue by using an
administrative tool to add a new print queue to a print server.

Main Success Scenario:

1.  By using the SMB protocol family, the administrative client copies the files for the printer driver to

a directory on the print server that is accessible via an SMB share.

2.  The administrative client uses the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN] to install the printer

driver on the print server. The driver is associated with a print queue in a later step of this use
case. In a network of print clients having different architectures, different versions of the same
driver are uploaded and installed by the administrative client, allowing the print server to provide
printer drivers to print clients whose architecture differs from the print server's architecture.

3.  The administrative client ensures that an executable module for a port monitor is present on the
print server (copying it there by using the SMB protocol family, if necessary), and then installs the
port monitor on the print server by using the Print System Remote Protocol. A port monitor
implements and exports the methods that the print server calls locally to interface with a port to
which a printer is connected. Ports for the port type that is implemented by the port monitor can
only be added to the print server after the port monitor is added.

4.  The administrator provides information about the port that connects the printer to the

administrative client, which then uses the Print System Remote Protocol to direct the print server
to add a specified printer port. A port is either a physical hardware port such as a parallel or USB
port, or a network port such as a WSD or TCP/IP port. The port is assigned to the print queue
in a following step.

5.  If the printer supports custom paper formats, called "forms", the administrative client can use the
Print System Remote Protocol to add definitions for those custom forms to the print server. When
added, such forms can be made available for use with the print queue.

6.  The administrative client uses the Print System Remote Protocol to create a print queue on the

print server. The administrator uses the administrative client to assign a printer driver, a printer
port, and a print processor to the print queue during this step, and also sets access permissions,
metadata, including name of printer, physical location, and comments, time of availability, name
under which the printer is shared, separator page settings, and processing priority.

7.  The administrative client uses the Print System Remote Protocol to direct the print server to

publish the print queue to the Active Directory system, which the print server satisfies by using
LDAP [RFC4511] to create a directory object for the print queue, supplying the UNC name (server
name plus share name) of the print queue. Print clients can then use LDAP to discover the print
queue.

Extension (a) - Install a print processor on the print server: Between steps 4 and 5 previously
described, if the installed printer driver does not contain a print processor, the administrative client
can use the Print System Remote Protocol to install a print processor on the print server.

Extension (b) – Enable Branch Office Print Mode: Between steps 6 and 7 previously described,
the administrative client can use the Print System Remote Protocol to set properties on the print
queue that control the Branch Office Print mode.

Variation (a) - Performing the use case using the protocol described in [MS-PAR]: All details
are identical to the use case described in this section except that the Print System Asynchronous
Remote Protocol [MS-PAR] is used to locate and establish the connection to the print queue.

2.5.3.2  Delete a Print Queue -- Administrative Client

Goal: To delete a previously provisioned print queue that is available on a print server, which
subsequently no longer enables a user to select the print queue, removing all attributes and
components that are necessary to make the print queue discoverable and accessible to a print client.

Context of Use: When a print queue is no longer required, an administrator uses an administrative
tool to delete a print queue from a print server. In Windows, this tool is the Print Management
Console. After an administrator deletes the print queue, a user by using a print client via an
application or the operating system can no longer send a print job to the printer.

Direct Actor: The direct actor is the administrative client.

Primary Actor: The primary actor is an administrator.

Supporting Actors: The supporting actors are the print server and the Active Directory system.

Stakeholders and Interests:

  Administrative client: The administrative client is used by an administrator to participate in this

use case to delete a previously provisioned print queue.

  Administrator: An administrator participates in this use case by using an administrative client to

configure a print server to delete a previously provisioned print queue.



Print server: A print server is configured by this use case so that a printer that is connected to the
print server can no longer be shared among multiple users via a queue that is located on the print
server.

  Active Directory system: The Active Directory system is updated by this use case so that the

listing of the print queue is no longer reported to a print client when a user attempts to locate a
print queue to which to send a print job.

Preconditions: The print server and the administrative client are connected by using a network
connection, and both are members of the domain. The print spooler service is operational on the

print server and administrative client. The Active Directory system is available and operational. The
print queue exists.

Minimal Guarantee: The administrative client is denied access, and no delete operations occur.

Success Guarantee: A print queue is deleted from a print server, and the Active Directory system is
updated to no longer return the print queue in directory queries.

Trigger: An administrator initiates the process of deleting a print queue by using an administrative
tool to delete a print queue on a print server.

Main Success Scenario:

The administrative client uses the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN] to direct the print server
to unpublish the print queue from the Active Directory system. The print server uses LDAP [RFC4511]
to delete the directory object for the print queue.

The administrative client uses the Print System Remote Protocol to delete the print queue on the print
server.

Extension (a) - Deleting objects that are no longer referenced on the print server: After
deleting the print queue, the administrative client can use the Print System Remote Protocol to
determine if the port, the print processor, and the printer driver that were previously used by the
deleted print queue are still in use by other print queues; and if that is not the case, the
administrative client can use the Print System Remote Protocol to delete those objects from the
server.

Variation (a) - Performing the use case by using the protocol described in [MS-PAR]: All
details are identical to the use case that is described in this section except that the Print System
Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR] is used to delete the print queue.

2.5.3.3  Locate and Establish a Connection to a Print Queue in a Domain Environment -

- Print Client

Goal: To make a connection to a shared print queue in a domain environment so that documents can
be printed by the user.

Context of Use: The user wants to print a document and does not have a printer attached to the
local computer, but the user is member of a domain and knows that there are shared print queues in
the enterprise that are available for use. The user decides to use one of the share print queues in the
enterprise and initiates this use case.

Direct Actor: The direct actor is the print client.

Primary Actor: The primary actor is a user.

Supporting Actors: The supporting actors are the print server, the Active Directory system, and
the Group Policy system in Extension (b).

Stakeholders and Interests:





Print client: The print client displays a list of shared print queues from which a user selects a print
queue, and then the print client establishes a connection to the selected print queue.

Print server: The print server provides information about the shared print queue to the print client,
makes the printer driver available to the print client for download if necessary, and enables the
print client to connect to the print queue.

  Active Directory system: The Active Directory system stores and provides a list of shared print

queues that the user views in the print client user interface.

Release: July 29, 2024

  Group Policy system: The Group Policy Deployed Printer Connections Extension [MS-GPDPC] is a
supporting actor in Extension (b). The Group Policy system is used to push a list of shared print
queues to the print client so that the print client has pre-established connections to specified print
queues. Additionally, Group Policy settings are inspected by the print client to restrict access to
certain print servers.

  User: The user wants to view a list of available shared print queues and selects a print queue to

which to send a print job.

Preconditions: The print spooler services are operational on the print client and print server. Both
are members of the domain and are connected through a network. The network is operational. The
Active Directory system is available and operational.

Minimal Guarantee: The print queue is located but the user is informed via the print client user
interface that a connection cannot be established due to insufficient permissions.

Success Guarantee: A connection to a shared print queue has been established by the print client,
and the connection can be used to submit print jobs to the print server.

Main Success Scenario:

1.  Trigger: A user initiates this use case by clicking the Add a printer command in the print client's

user interface.

2.  The print client queries the Active Directory system for a list of shared print queues in the domain.

3.  The Active Directory system replies with a list of shared print queues.

4.  The user of the print client selects a print queue from the query results.

5.  The print client opens a handle to the selected print queue by using the Print System Remote

Protocol [MS-RPRN].

6.  The print client queries the print server for information about the print queue, such as which

printer driver (and version) is being used, and the hardware ID of the printer represented by the
print queue.

7.  If the print client already has a copy of the printer driver installed, the print client creates a local

print queue proxy object. The proxy object represents the connection to the print queue on the
print server. See Extension (a) for a description of the case where the print client does not already
have a copy of the printer driver installed.

Extension (a) – The print client downloads a printer driver:

Step 6: If the print client does not have a copy of the printer driver installed, the print client
obtains the printer driver from one of the following sources, identifying the printer driver using the
hardware ID of the print queue obtained earlier:







From an administrative share on the print server

From Windows Update

From the user, for example, from a CD

The print client then locally installs the printer driver.

Extension (b) - Print client makes connections only to print queues specified by Group
Policy [MS-GPDPC] deployed printer connections:

Replace previous steps 1 through 3 with the following steps:

44 / 104

[MS-PRSOD] - v20240729
Print Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: July 29, 2024

1.  An administrator defines one or more deployed printer connection Group Policy settings for
one or more domain users or user groups. Each Group Policy setting includes details of one or
more print queues that are shared by the print server.

2.  By using the Group Policy Deployed Printer Connections Extension, the print client retrieves
the deployed printer connections for the logged-on user and the current computer and
proceeds to automatically make connections to all print queues that are specified in the Group
Policy settings, without user interaction in steps 4 through 6 for each print queue connection.

Extension (c) – The print client registers for notifications of print queue status:

Step 6 is followed by:

8.  When the print queue proxy representing the connection has been created, the print client opens a
handle to the selected print queue by using the Print System Remote Protocol. The print client
registers with the print server for some or all supported notifications on that handle, which then
are sent to the print client when they become available. The print client reflects state changes of
the server print queue in the local print queue proxy object. (such state changes can be, among
others:error state, online/offline state, printer paused, list of queued jobs, associated printer
driver - fetching and installing a different or updated printer driver if necessary, and so on.)

Extension (d) – The print client creates a Branch Office Printing version of the print
queue:

Step 6 is followed by:

Step 7. When the print queue proxy representing the connection has been created, the print client
opens a handle to the selected print queue by using the Print System Remote Protocol. The print
client then requests the Branch Office Print configuration data from the print server for the print
queue. If the Branch Office Print Mode is enabled for this print queue, the print client configures
the print queue proxy object to communicate directly with the device for print operations instead
of with the print server.

Variation (a) - Performing the use case by using the protocol as described in [MS-PAR]:
All details are identical to the use case that is described in this section, except that the Print
System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR] is used instead of the Print System Remote
Protocol.

2.5.3.4  Locate and Establish a Connection to a Print Queue in a Workgroup

Environment -- Print Client

Goal: To make a connection to a shared print queue in a workgroup environment so that documents
can be printed by the user.

Context of Use: The user wants to print a document and does not have a printer attached to the
local computer, but the user is member of a workgroup and knows that there are shared print queues
in the workgroup that are available for use. The user decides to use one of the shared print queues in
the workgroup and initiates this use case.

Direct Actor: The direct actor is the print client.

Primary Actor: The primary actor is a user.

Supporting Actors: The supporting actors are print clients performing a print server role.

Stakeholders and Interests:



Print client: The print client displays a list of shared print queues from which a user selects a print
queue, and then the print client establishes a connection to the selected print queue.

Release: July 29, 2024



Print clients that perform a print server role: In this use case, the print server role is performed by
print clients that have shared print queues. After a user shares a print queue on the computer, the
computer performs print server functions, including providing printer drivers to print clients, and
accepting and printing print jobs from print clients. These print servers announce themselves to
all other computers acting as print servers in the workgroup, as well as storing a list of all the
other computers performing the print server role.

  User: The user wants to view a list of available shared print queues and selects a print queue to

which to send a print job.

Preconditions: The print server has used the CIFS Browser Protocol [MS-BRWS] to find other
computers that act as print servers and print clients in the workgroup, and then used the Print System
Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN] to push the list of shared print queues to all print servers in the
workgroup. The print server has also notified all other computers in the workgroup that it is a print
server itself by using the CIFS Browser Protocol. The print spooler service is operational on the print
server and the print client. Both are connected through a network connection.

Minimal Guarantee: The print queue is located but the user is informed via the print client user
interface that a connection cannot be established due to insufficient permissions.

Success Guarantee: A connection to a shared print queue has been established by the print client
and the connection can be used to submit print jobs to the print server.

Main Success Scenario:

1.  Trigger: A user initiates this use case by clicking the Add a printer command in the print client

user interface.

2.  The print client queries print servers in the workgroup for lists of shared print queues.

3.  The user of the print client selects a print queue from a displayed list of shared print queues in the

workgroup.

4.  The print client opens a handle to the selected print queue by using the Print System Remote

Protocol.

5.  The print client queries the print server for information about the print queue, such as which

printer driver (and version) is being used, and the hardware ID of the printer that is represented
by the print queue.

6.  If the print client already has a copy of the printer driver installed, the print client creates a local
print queue proxy object representing the connection to the print queue on the print server. See
Extension (a) for a description of the case of where the print client does not already have a copy
of the printer driver installed.

Extension (a) – The print client downloads a printer driver:

Step 4: After opening a handle to the selected print queue, if the print client does not have a copy of
the printer driver installed, the print client downloads the printer driver from either (a) Windows
Update, by using the hardware ID of the print queue that was obtained earlier, or (b) from an
administrative printer share of the print server or other print client in the workgroup. The print client
then locally installs the printer driver before proceeding with the rest of the use case.

Extension (b) – The print client registers for notifications of the print queue status:

Step 4. When the print queue representing the connection has been created, the print client opens a
handle to the selected print queue by using the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol. The print
client then registers with the print server or another print client for some or all supported notifications
on that handle, which are sent when they become available.

The print client updates the local print queue object with changes to the server print queue, including
error state, online/offline state, and the list of queued jobs; changes in an associated printer driver
when a different or updated driver is retrieved and installed; and changes in printer state, such as
when a printer paused. The print client unregisters for notifications when it no longer has to issue
notifications; for example, because the user closes the user interface that shows status changes.

Variation (a) - Performing the use case by using the protocol as described in [MS-PAR]: All
details are identical to the use case that is described in this section except that the Print System
Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR], is used instead of the Print System Remote Protocol.

2.5.3.5  Locating and Connecting to a Shared Print Queue from an Internet Client --

Print Client

Goal: To make a connection to a shared print queue from an Internet client so that documents can be
printed by the user.

Context of Use: The user wants to print a document and does not have a printer attached to the
local computer. The environment blocks connections, for example, via a firewall, by using the Print
System Remote Protocol and Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR]. As an
alternative, IPP [RFC8011] [RFC8010] and the Web Point-and-Print Protocol [MS-WPRN] are available
because they use HTTP/HTTPS and are allowed by most firewall administrators. By using these
protocols, the print client enables the user to select a shared printer via the Internet.

Direct Actor: The direct actor is the print client.

Primary Actor: The primary actor is the user.

Supporting Actors: The supporting actors are the print server and the Internet browser.

Stakeholders and Interests:







Print client: The print client can make a connection to a print queue when the user enters the
name of the print queue, and then download a printer driver by using the Web Point-and-Print
Protocol. The print client sends a print job to the print queue by using IPP.

Print server: The print server receives an HTTP GET request [RFC7231] from an Internet browser,
generates a list of shared printers in HTML format, and responds to the HTTP GET request with
the list to the print client. The print server also provides a printer driver to the print client.

Internet browser: The Internet browser is used to connect to a print server and to view shared
print queues on the print server. It can also be used to connect the print client to a selected print
queue by executing script code that calls local APIs of the print spooler. Alternately, the user can
use the Internet browser only for finding out the name of the print queue, and can then enter that
name in the print client user interface to connect to the print queue.

  User: The user wants to send a print job to a print queue but cannot use the print client to

discover the shared print queues due to network restrictions.

Preconditions: The optional Internet Printing server role component has been installed on the print
server. The print spooler service is operational on the print server and on the print client. An
HTTP/HTTPS connection can be established between the print client and the print server. The user
knows the URL of the print server.

Minimal Guarantee: A connection cannot be made.

Success Guarantee: A connection can be made.

Trigger: A user initiates this use case by starting the Add a printer command in the print client user
interface.

Main Success Scenario:

1.  The user of an Internet browser browses to the "http://<HOST>/printers" URL of the print server

that has the address <HOST>.

2.  The print server returns an HTML page that shows the available print queues and their status.

3.  The user selects a print queue to which to connect.

4.  The print client uses the Web Point-and-Print Protocol to download the printer driver for the print

queue from the print server.

5.  The print client installs the downloaded printer driver.

6.  The print client creates a local print queue proxy object that represents the IPP connection to the

print queue on the print server.

Extensions: None.

2.5.3.6  Setting Permissions for a Print Queue -- Administrative Client

Goal: To set permissions for a print queue, such as the priority of the print queue and the times that
it is available for shared use, and who can access it.

Context of Use: The administrator wants to restrict use of a shared print queue to a selected group
of users or individual users. Additionally, the administrator wants to restrict the times of day when the
shared print queue is available for use.

Direct Actor: The direct actor is the administrative client.

Primary Actor: The primary actor is the administrator.

Supporting Actors: The supporting actors are the print server and the Active Directory system.

Stakeholders and Interests:

  Administrative client: The administrative client connects to the print server to send information

regarding restrictions on the use of shared print queues.



Print server: The print server restricts the use of shared print queues as specified by the
administrative client.

  Administrator: The administrator wants to restrict the use of a shared print queue to a selected

group of users.

Preconditions: The print server and administrative client are connected by using a network
connection, and both are members of the domain. The print spooler service is operational on the
print server and on the administrative client.

Minimal Guarantee: The administrative client denies the administrator the privilege to set
permissions based on the administrator's authorization.

Success Guarantee: The permissions and time restrictions are set as requested.

Trigger: An administrator initiates the process of setting the permissions for a print queue by
selecting a print queue by using an administrative client.

Main Success Scenario:

1.  The administrative client uses the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN] to enumerate the

print queues on the print server.

2.  The administrator selects one of the enumerated print queues.

3.  The administrative client uses the Print System Remote Protocol to open a handle to an existing

print queue on the print server.

4.  The administrative client uses LDAP [RFC4511] to obtain a list of domain users and groups from

the Active Directory system.

5.  The administrator selects users and groups from the list that is obtained in step 4 and assigns

access permissions to form an access control list (ACL) and a security descriptor.

6.  The administrative client uses the Print System Remote Protocol to set the requested security

descriptor on the print queue.

7.  The administrator further chooses a time interval in which the print queue accepts print jobs

from print clients.

8.  The administrative client uses the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR] to set

the requested availability time interval on the print queue.

9.  The administrative client closes the printer handle.

Extensions: None.

Variation (a) - Performing the use case by using the protocol as described in [MS-PAR]: All
details are identical to the use case as described in this section except that the Print System
Asynchronous Remote Protocol is used instead of the Print System Remote Protocol.

2.5.3.7  Submitting a Print Job -- Print Client

2.5.3.7.1 Submitting a Print Job Using the Protocols Defined in [MS-RPRN] (or [MS-

PAR])

Goal: To print a document.

Context of Use: The user using an application capable of printing a document wants to print. A
connection to a shared print queue has been previously established. The user initiates the Print
command from the application.

Direct Actor: The direct actor is the print client.

Primary Actor: The primary actor is the user.

Supporting Actors: The supporting actor is the print server.

Stakeholders and Interests:





Print client: The print client sends the print job data to the print queue on the print server.

Print server: The print server buffers the print job data that is sent to the print queue to which the
print client is connected, optionally processes the print job data further, and sends it to the printer
that is associated with the print queue.

  User: The user wants a printed copy of content on the computer and chooses the Print function

from the print client user interface.

Preconditions: The print spooler services are operational on the print client and on the print server.
Both are members of the domain and are connected with a network. The network is operational. The
Active Directory system is available and operational.

Release: July 29, 2024

Minimal Guarantee: The print job was submitted to the print server, but no job status feedback
could be initiated; therefore, the print job might print, but the print client cannot show feedback.

Success Guarantee: The job is submitted, and job progress status was received and displayed to the
user.

Trigger: A user initiates this use case by selecting the command from a printing capable application.

Main Success Scenario:

1.  The print client opens a printer handle using the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN].

2.  The print client starts a new print job to the print server by using the Print System Remote

Protocol.

3.  The print client indicates the start of a new logical page to the print server, repeatedly sends data
for the page, and signals the end of a logical page to the print server by using the Print System
Remote Protocol. The print client repeats this step for all pages in the document.

4.  After sending all the pages of the print job to the print server, the print client ends the print job by

using the Print System Remote Protocol.

5.  The print client closes the printer handle by using the Print System Remote Protocol.

Extension (a) – The print client obtains notifications about the print job status:

Following the previous step 1 and before step 2: The print client registers for change notifications by
using the Print System Remote Protocol.

In parallel with the remaining steps, the print server sends change notifications during the processing
of the print job. The print client provides feedback to the user.

Extension (b) – The print client obtains notifications for IHV-defined components on the
print server and displays the user interface to the user:

Prior to the previous step 1, the print client uses the Print System Remote Protocol to register for
change notifications from the print server.

In parallel with the other steps of the use case, when the print client receives change notifications that
signal the arrival of a new print job, the print client attempts to listen to the print queue for
connection requests from the print server by using the Print System Asynchronous Notification
Protocol [MS-PAN]. An IHV-defined printer driver or other IHV-defined component that is running on
the print server can act as a notification source by using the Print System Asynchronous Notification
Protocol and send unidirectional or bidirectional notification messages to the print client. One
important notification message type for IHV-defined components is used to request that the print
client displays a user interface to the user.

After step 4, if a connection has been established between the print client and the IHV-defined
components using the Print System Asynchronous Notification Protocol, then the print client continues
to listen for print server change notifications signaling the end of the print job for the monitored print
queue. The print client closes the asynchronous notification connection when all the jobs have been
processed.

Variation (a) - Performing the use case by using the protocol as described in [MS-PAR]: All
details are identical to the use case described in this section except that the Print System
Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR] is used instead of the Print System Remote Protocol.

Preconditions: The print spooler services are operational on the print client and the print server.
Both are members of the domain and are connected to a network. The network is operational. The
Active Directory system is available and operational.

Minimal Guarantee: The print job was submitted to the print server, but no job status feedback
could be initiated. The print job might print, but the print client cannot show feedback.

Success Guarantee: The job is submitted, and job progress status was received and displayed to the
user.

Trigger: A user initiates this use case by selecting the Print command from a printing capable
application.

Main Success Scenario:

1.  The user initiates a print job from a Windows application to a print queue that is a connected to an

IPP [RFC8011] [RFC8010] print queue on the print server.

2.  The print client uses IPP to submit the print job to that print queue.

3.  The print client indicates the start of a new logical page to the print server, repeatedly sends data
for the page, and signals the end of a logical page to the print server by using the Print System
Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN]. The print client repeats this step for all pages in the document.

4.  After sending all the pages of the print job to the print server, the print client ends the print job by

using the Print System Remote Protocol.

5.  The print client closes the printer handle by using the Print System Remote Protocol.

Extensions: None.

them (cancel, reorder, pause, and resume).

Main Success Scenario:

1.  The user uses the net print command [MSFT-NETPRINT] to enumerate print jobs on the print

queue.<7>

2.  The print client uses RAP [MS-RAP] to enumerate print jobs on the print queue of the print server.

3.  The user uses the net print command to pause, resume, or cancel print jobs on the print queue.

4.  The print client uses RAP to pause, resume, or cancel a print job.

2.6  Versioning, Capability Negotiation, and Extensibility

The Print Services system (PSS) evolved over multiple releases of Windows client and server products
(Microsoft Implementations section 4). Each version of the Print Services system provides additional
functionality, while maintaining interoperability with previous versions.<8>

The functionality in these versions is incremental. A third-party print server that interoperates with a
Windows print client supports all the functionality for a given version and the versions that preceded
it.

For example, if PSS 3.0 included a protocol that defines opnum operation numbers or numeric
identifiers 1 through 10, and PSS 4.0 included a new protocol and an extension to the PSS 3.0
protocol that defines a new opnum 11, then Windows print clients require that the print server
supports the new PSS 4.0 protocol and the opnum 11 extension to the PSS 3.0 protocol.

Support for some protocols is optional, as shown in the functional relationships of member protocols
(section 2.1.2.3) and later in this section. An implementation can be fully functional in a typical
Windows network without implementing the optional protocols.

The print client or the administrative client determines the print server's PSS version support by
calling Print System Remote Protocol methods [MS-RPRN]:

1.  The print client calls the RpcOpenPrinter method on the print server by using the print server's

name to obtain a handle.

2.  The print client calls the RpcGetPrinterData method on the print server by using the OSVersion
key to obtain the print server's operating system version and maps the OSVersion of the print
server to the supported PSS version.

3.  The print client calls the RpcClosePrinter method on the print server to close the print server

handle.

In addition to following the process that was previously described to determine the capabilities of the
print server, print clients also follow the processes that are described by the protocols of the Print
Services system for negotiating capability support.

The following tables describe how the protocols in the Print Services system are supported by the
different versions of the system. The Windows product releases that correspond to each version of the
Print Services system are listed in the Product Behavior Appendix.<9>

Microsoft-defined protocols, standard protocols, and print payloads are described in the following
tables.

Server Easy Print installed.

SMB: Print clients use this protocol for driver file
download operations, or if neither the Print
System Remote Protocol nor the Print System
Asynchronous Remote Protocol is available on a
print server.

Print System Remote Protocol: Windows print
clients use this protocol to find out whether the
Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol is
available on the print server.<10> Clients check
the server's OS build number, retrieved by using
Print System Remote Protocol methods, and to
confirm a printer's presence with a single
RpcOpenPrinter/RpcClosePrinter sequence.
The client subsequently uses Print System
Asynchronous Remote Protocol methods.

Windows print clients also use the Print System
Remote Protocol if the Print System Asynchronous
Remote Protocol is unavailable on the print
server.

EMFSPOOL: Print clients can use this payload
format only if the print server advertises support
with the

Vendor-specific extensions are supported as noted in section 1.8 of the member protocol specification
Technical Documents (TDs).

2.7  Error Handling

Status and error returns are defined by member protocols of the Print Services system. The Print
Services system does not define status codes or error codes in addition to those described in the
technical documents relating to the member protocols.

2.7.1  Failure Scenarios

The following failure scenarios are discussed in this section:

  Abnormal termination of the print spooler service







Loss of network connectivity

Loss of system disk storage

Print spooler service out-of-system resources

  Authentication issues



Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: July 29, 2024

60 / 104

2.7.1.1  Abnormal Termination of the Print Spooler Service

This problem is typically caused by a malfunctioning plug-in module, such as an IHV-supplied printer
driver. Other causes include internal malfunction of the print spooler service and sudden loss of
system power. The print spooler service terminates immediately without an orderly shutdown. The
system attempts to restart the print spooler service multiple times before giving up, at which point
administrative intervention locally on the system experiencing the failure is required to diagnose the
problem and take corrective action.

All print jobs that are completely submitted at the time of failure remain queued, and their
processing is restarted from the beginning on print spooler restart.

Print clients are not informed of an abnormal termination event, and experience failures on currently
executing calls and all subsequent calls that are made through member protocols. Print clients
implement appropriate RPC rundown handlers to free RPC resources that are associated with handles
and are in use at the time of failure. Print clients retry those failed calls until the print server is
available again.

In a system configuration in which printer drivers are run by the print spooler in the print spooler's
address space, an abnormal termination or memory corruption in a printer driver can abnormally
terminate the print spooler process.

In a system configuration in which printer drivers are run in isolation processes, commonly called a
sandbox,<11> a malfunctioning printer driver causes only the isolation process to terminate. Print
clients are not informed of such a failure. All current completely submitted print jobs for all printer
drivers sharing the terminated isolation process remain queued, and their processing is restarted from
the beginning on restart of the isolation process. The print spooler attempts to restart the isolation
process for a malfunctioning printer driver two times before giving up. In this case, locally on the
system that experiences the failure, administrative intervention is required to diagnose the problem
and to take corrective action.

2.7.1.2  Loss of Network Connectivity

In case of connectivity loss, the protocol handler for each member protocol tries independently to
reconnect. There is no system-wide detection of connectivity loss.

2.7.1.3  Loss of System Disk Storage

Loss of system disk storage is a fatal, non-recoverable event. The behavior of the system in this case
is undefined and unpredictable. The print spooler service of the affected system is restarted
manually when system storage comes back online.

2.7.1.4  Print Spooler Service Out of System Resources

Method calls to member protocols return a nonzero error code if the server cannot process the request
due to lack of system resources (such as memory, handles, or disk space). There is no system-wide
mechanism for dealing with a server that is out of system resources.

2.7.1.5  Authentication Issues

Authentication is handled independently for each component protocol. Credential storage on
Windows makes a distinction between session-based transports, such as RPC over SMB, and non-
session-based transports, such as RPC over TCP/IP. If secondary credentials have been added by the
user or another subsystem has been added to Credential Manager, these credentials are only used for
protocol requests by using session-based transport. They are unavailable for non-session based
transports.

Specifically, that means that requests over the Print System Asynchronous protocols [MS-PAR] [MS-
PAN] can fail due to failed authentication, even if requests over the Print System Remote Protocol
[MS-RPRN] operate correctly. Print client architecture is designed to handle these failures gracefully
and to fall back to using the Print System Remote Protocol if the Print System Asynchronous protocols
fail due to authentication issues. Therefore, functionality that is specific to the Print System
Asynchronous protocols can be unavailable in such a fallback scenario.

2.7.1.6  Expected Failures

A group of failures that are caused by malfunctioning printers are considered expected failures. The
member protocols contain facilities to report the type of failure to the print client. The print client
responds to failures typically in an implementation-specific manner, such as by retrying, for example,
in a printer offline scenario, and by offering visual feedback to the user. The user can then make a
choice of further action, such as canceling the job and reprinting to a different print queue, or walking
up to the printer and fixing a paper jam.

Another kind of expected failure is that a buffer proves too small to receive data that is returned by an
RPC call.

2.8  Coherency Requirements

2.8.1  Timers

If the print server is configured and Active Directory is available, the print server performs the
following operations:





Periodically enumerate through the List of Printers and update the Active Directory ([MS-
RPRN] section 2.3.3.4).

Periodically search for the print queues in Active Directory ([MS-RPRN] section 2.3.3.3) and delete
all print queues that are not present in the current List of Printers ([MS-RPRN] (section 2.3.3.2).

2.8.2  Non-Timer Events

When a system shutdown event occurs:





The Print Services system closes all open handles to remote objects.

The Print Services system unregisters endpoints.

When a local Plug and Play event occurs:

  When new printer hardware is detected on a local port of a computer that acts as print server, the
Print Services system automatically locates a matching driver for the detected printer and installs
a print queue. The created print queue can optionally be set up as a shared print queue depending
on policy setting.

2.8.3  Initialization and Reinitialization Procedures

Initialization occurs at system startup, which starts the print spooler service.

The print spooler service listens on endpoints for protocols in the following order:

  At any time: Starts listening to the Line Printer Daemon Protocol [RFC1179], which occurs in a

separate Windows service, LPDSVC. In Windows, Internet Information Services (IIS) performs this
process.

[MS-PRSOD] - v20240729
Print Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: July 29, 2024

62 / 104

  At any time: Starts listening to Web Point-and-Print Protocol [MS-WPRN] and the Internet Printing
Protocol [RFC8011] [RFC8010] simultaneously, or in the listed order. In Windows, IIS performs
this process.

  At any time: Starts listening to Print System Asynchronous Notification Protocol [MS-PAN], Print
System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR], and Print System Remote Protocol [MS-PAR]
simultaneously, or in the listed order.

Reinitialization occurs up to two times only on abnormal termination of the print spooler service.

The Print Services system starts up automatically when the server that hosts the Print Services
system starts. The Print Services system stays in the running state until the print server shuts down,
or it is manually stopped by an administrator.

The Print Services system persists elements of the ADM in the system registry.

On initialization, print services instantiate in-memory objects according to persisted information. This
instantiation does not occur until after conditions are met that show the machine to be fully ready to
use, such as after a user logs on or after a significant time has elapsed after startup.<12>

2.9  Security

This section documents system-wide security issues that are not otherwise described in the Technical
Documents (TDs) for the member protocols. It does not duplicate what is already in the member
protocol TDs unless there is some unique aspect that applies to the system as a whole.

Windows Print Services allow installation of printer drivers on a print client from local storage media
or to copy the printer drivers from the print server for the shared printer. Windows printer drivers
contain executable modules that are loaded and executed in the local system account by the print
spooler.

As another mitigating tactic, a system administrator can restrict printer driver installation by the
application of Group Policy settings that are accepted by the print client.

Print Services secures access to print queues and ports that are shared by a print server by using
access control lists (ACLs). However, printers on a network that is connected via the TCPMON
monitor module ([MS-RPRN] section 3.1.4.11.3), WSDMON monitor module ([MS-RPRN] section
3.1.4.11.4), or APMON ([MS-RPRN] section 3.1.4.11.5) do not offer a mechanism for access
protection. Therefore, print clients can bypass the print server's protection mechanism by creating a
direct TCPMON, WSDMON, or APMON connection to a printer. The address of the printer can be
determined by scanning the local network for ports that are used by TCPMON, WSDMON, or APMON
connections. Often, it is also possible to find printers by examining Domain Name System (DNS)
entries for the local network, or by printing a printer status sheet on the printer itself. The status
sheet typically shows the DNS name or the TCP/IP address of the printer.

Because of these limitations, in a Print Services installation with heightened access security
requirements for printers, we recommend to connect the printers to a private network that is only
accessible by the print server. In such a configuration, the print server always acts as an intermediary
between the print client and the printer, and therefore can effectively enforce access security.

An additional security concern is the actual security and accessibility of the physically printed pages
that result from a print job. The Print Services system does not offer any solution for this problem;
however, multiple Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV)-specific solutions exist, in which the IHV-
provided printer driver that is running on the print client embeds a PIN that is only known to the user
into the IHV-specific command stream that is sent to the printer. The printer only prints or releases
the physical print job after the user is identified with the PIN at the printer.

Another security concern is that the member protocols of the Print Services system do not require the
use of heightened transport security, as indicated by use of the

63 / 104

[MS-PRSOD] - v20240729
Print Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: July 29, 2024

RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY or RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY authentication-level
constants. Consequently print job data and other data that are transmitted by using member protocols
cannot be relied upon to be secure. Such data can potentially be intercepted or tampered with. A
secure print environment is achieved by employing the underlying transport security mechanisms,
such as Internet Protocol security (IPsec) [RFC4301].

2.9.1  Security and Authentication Methods

Versioning of security is handled by the underlying RPC transport ([MS-RPCE] section 3.3.3.3).

Policy settings controlling local print spooler behavior can be pushed by using the Group Policy: Core
Protocol [MS-GPOL] from the directory server to print clients and print servers.<13> This functionality
enables the following settings:

  Driver installation security settings

  Sandbox grouping settings

2.9.2  Securable Objects

The securable objects in the Print Services system are the print job object, the print queue object,
and the print server object. Security for these objects is discussed in [MS-RPRN], [MS-PAR], and [MS-
PAN].

Print services apply ACLs to elements of the ADM for the member protocols. In a typical managed
network, default ACLs allow users the Use access right for all elements accessible through the member
protocols, and allow administrators unrestricted access for all elements accessible through the
member protocols.

2.9.3  Internal Security

The Print Services system applies ACLs to elements in its ADM. When processing calls, the system
impersonates the calling user and verifies access to a secured element through the authenticated
user identity ([MS-PAN] section 3.1.1.6.5).

2.9.4  External Security

The Print Services system impersonates the user when it processes calls. The permissions in the user's
token determine the type of access this system has to external resources while it processes calls.

Print clients and print servers for Print Services enforce extra security measures when printer drivers
or other plug-ins are referenced on a remote system or are copied from a remote system. Printer
drivers or other plug-ins can contain executable code. Therefore, they are constrained to execute only
in the context of the local caller if they are trusted.

The Windows print spooler calls printer drivers or other plug-ins as local system calls and
impersonates the calling user. Therefore, the print spooler takes appropriate precautions to protect
the system from harm by untrusted printer drivers.

The Windows implementation can perform one or more of the following actions:

  Restrict non-administrative users from installing printer drivers.

  Check the digital signatures of printer drivers.



Prompt the user for consent before downloading such components or before executing the
component for the first time.

3  Examples

The following examples illustrate the protocols that are used by the Print Services system to perform
the following:

  Discover and use a print queue in a domain.

  Discover and use a print queue in a workgroup.







Locate a print queue in a domain and establish a connection, then submit a print job to a manual
duplex printer by using the Print System Asynchronous Notification Protocol [MS-PAN] and enable
bidirectional IHV-defined communication between the print client and the print server.

Enumerate print jobs from all users, and then cancel several print jobs.

Provision a print queue by using the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN], from an
administrative client, and then delete the same print queue by using the Print System
Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR] from a different administrative client.

  Send a print job to an SMB share.

In all examples in this section, the print client opens, closes, and reopens the handle to the print
queue multiple times. This is because the Windows API implementation for the print spooler enables
and uses different processes for the print client user interface, print client applications, and internal
features of the print spooler. Each of these processes can have multiple threads. For example, an
application can have one thread printing in the background and another thread computing layout in
the foreground. Other queries to the print server, for example, about print jobs could occur in parallel
from different threads, which cause additional exchanges that are unrelated to a specific scenario on
the network.

In all examples in this section, the print client retrieves information from the print server in arbitrary
order, and often retrieves the same information redundantly. Methods that could be called in arbitrary
order and be called redundantly are marked with an asterisk (*) in the examples.

Because handles are not generally portable between threads, and are never portable between
processes, the print client could also use different handles to the same print queue for different
functions, such as listening for notifications and submitting a print job.

3.1  Example 1: Discovering and Utilizing a Print Queue in a Domain

This example demonstrates the use cases described in section 2.5.3.3 with extensions (a) and (c), and
section 2.5.3.7.1 with extension (a).

Prior to the beginning of this example, an administrator has installed a printer on a print server and
provisioned a print queue corresponding to the printer. The print server has published the name of the
print queue to the directory service by using LDAP [RFC4511]. In this scenario, PSS uses LDAP to
discover the available shared print queues, after which it uses the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-
RPRN] and the SMB access protocols for subsequent operations.

Prerequisites

The example described in this section and subsections has the following prerequisites:



The print client communicates with the print server by using the Print System Remote
Protocol, which includes support for the RpcGetPrinterDriverPackagePath method.<14>



The print queue has been provisioned and is located on a print server in a domain.









The print server has published a list of the shared print queues to the Active Directory
system.

The print client is configured not to use Windows Update to obtain the printer driver. This
precondition is only present to illustrate downloading a printer driver from the print server.

The printer driver is available from the printer server, and the print driver is enabled as
package aware.<15>

Either the print client or the print server supports the Print System Remote Protocol but not
the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR].<16> This precondition was chosen
to illustrate the fallback use of the Print System Remote Protocol.<17>

Initial System State

The example described in this section and subsections applies in the following initial system state:







The user of the print client does not know the name of the print server, and the print client
does not yet have a list of the available print servers or print queues.

The print client does not have the printer driver for the print queue.

The print client does not have the printer driver package for the printer driver in its local
driver store. This state is presented to illustrate a printer driver download from the print
server.

Final System State

The print client obtains the list of available printers and print servers.

The print client has downloaded a printer driver for the print queue.

Tasks

This example is divided into four tasks:





Locating print queue in a domain

Establishing a connection, downloading a driver, and registering for notifications

  Submitting a print job and receiving notifications

  Unregistering from notifications

Task 1: Locating a print queue in a domain

Figure 16: Print client locating a print queue in a domain by using LDAP

The message group labeled "Locating a print queue in a domain" in the preceding diagram represents
the search for a print queue in Active Directory by using the LDAP search option ([RFC4511] section
4.5 and [MS-RPRN] section 2.3.3.3).

The following steps describe task 1 of this example.

1.  The print client uses LDAP to query the LDAP server for print queues, optionally specifying
criteria, such as functionality, that the print queues are required to satisfy. The print client
obtains criteria from the user interface and makes several queries to obtain criteria, such as
the physical location of the print client.

2.  The LDAP server returns a list of print queues by using LDAP. The print client user interface

then presents the list to the user who selects a print queue.

Task 2: Establishing a connection, downloading a driver, and registering for notifications

The following diagram shows a print client that connects to a print queue, downloads a driver, and
registers for notifications. The sequence is described in the steps that follow the diagram.

Figure 18: Print client submitting a print job to the print queue

The message group labeled "Submitting a print job and receiving notifications" in the preceding
diagram shows how the client receives asynchronous notification of changes on the print queue and
how the client submits a print job ([MS-RPRN] sections 3.1.4.9.1, 3.1.4.9.2, 3.1.4.9.3, 3.1.4.9.4, and
3.1.4.9.7).

The following steps describe task 3 of this example:

Asynchronously on a separate thread, during each of the steps of task 3 and until the print server has
finished processing the print job, the print server calls the RpcRouterReplyPrinterEx method to
notify the print client of changes on the print queue, such as job processing progress, status changes,
or other changes. The print client responds to each notification with a success code.

29. The print client calls the RpcOpenPrinterEx method on the print server to open a handle to

server returns a job ID and a success code.

31. The print client calls the RpcStartPagePrinter method on the print server, and the print

server responds with a success code.

32. The print client repeatedly calls the RpcWritePrinter method on the print server, by sending
successive portions of the print job. The print server responds to each call with a success
code. This step is repeated until all the print data has been sent.

33. The print client calls the RpcEndPagePrinter method on the print server, and the print

server responds with a success code.

returns a success code. This step only occurs if the print client does not proceed to the next
portion of this example.

Task 4: Unregistering from notifications

The following diagram shows the print client unregistering from notifications.

Unregistering from
notifications

The print client unregisters from notifications of
changes to the print queue.

[MS-RPRN] section
3.1.4.10.2

Disconnecting from a print
queue

The print client closes the handle to the printer object.

[MS-RPRN] section
3.1.4.2.9

The following steps describe task 4 of this example:

36. When a print client has no further use for notifications, for example, when the user closes the

print queue dialog user interface, the print client calls the
RpcFindClosePrinterChangeNotification method on the print server.

37. The print server calls the RpcReplyClosePrinter method on the print client, and the print

client returns a success code.

38. The print server responds to the RpcFindClosePrinterChangeNotification method with a

success code.

39. The print client calls the RpcClosePrinter method on the print server by using the handle to
the print queue that was specified during registration, and the print server returns a success
code.

It is common for clients to listen for notifications from more than one thread. Therefore, the sequence
of steps for registration for notifications, from task 2, and unregistration, from task 3, can be observed
on the network multiple times.

3.2  Example 2: Discovering and Utilizing a Print Queue in a Workgroup

This example demonstrates the use cases described in section 2.5.3.4 and section 2.5.3.7.1.

In this example, a computer in a workgroup locates a shared print queue on another computer in the
workgroup and sends a print job to the shared print queue.

In this example, there is no dedicated print server, no domain has been established, and no directory
system is available. The clients in the workgroup are distinguished by their roles, already established,
as follows:







Print server: One client in the workgroup is established as a print server and has already
announced the shared print queues that it hosts to all other print servers in the workgroup, if
there are any, by using the CIFS Browser Protocol [MS-BRWS]. The printers are shared by
using the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN].<20>

Print client: One client is distinguished as a print client in the workgroup when it is directed by
the user to send a print job to a print server. This print client can behave in other roles, such
as print server or print browser server, but for this example the client acts in the role of a
print client only.

Print browser server: One client in the workgroup is established as the print browser server,
which enumerates available print servers and print queues to print clients. The print browser
server has already announced this role to all the clients in the workgroup by using the CIFS
Browser Protocol. Print clients locate the print browser server by using the CIFS and RAP
protocols through a NetServerEnum method call in which the Level field is set to 101 and
the Flags field to SV_TYPE_PRINTQ_SERVER. In order to act in the role of the print browser
server, the print client also plays the role of a print server with at least one available shared
print queue.

Only one print server in the workgroup behaves as the active print browser server at any given time.
Other print servers, if there are any, behave as backup print browser servers. One of them becomes
the new active print browser server if the current active print browser server becomes unavailable.
The print browser server and the backup print browser servers exchange information about shared
print queues in the workgroup by calling the RpcAddPrinter method ([MS-RPRN] section 3.1.4.2.3)
and using the PRINTER_INFO_* structures ().

Typically, the first workgroup client that takes on the role of a print server that shares a print queue
also becomes the print browser server for the workgroup.

Prerequisites

This example has the following prerequisites:







The general requirements as listed in Assumptions and Preconditions, section 2.4, are met.

Participating clients are configured to be members of the same workgroup.

The \pipe\spoolss endpoint can be accessed anonymously.

  All participating clients support the CIFS Browser Protocol.

  One of the clients has at least one shared print queue, so that at least one client is of type

SV_TYPE_PRINTQ_SERVER, which is a requirement for this example.





Either the print client or print server supports the Print System Remote Protocol but not the
Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR].<21> This precondition was chosen to
illustrate the use of Print System Remote Protocol.<22>

The print client is configured to not use Windows Update to obtain the printer driver. This
precondition is presented to illustrate the printer driver download from the print server.



The printer driver is available from the print server's print$ share.

structure the client requires ([MS-RPRN] section 3.1.4.2.1).

2.  The server returns ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER and sets the countBytesNeeded parameter
to the size that is required to store the requested printer information structures for all shared
print queues.

3.  The client allocates an amount of memory equal to countBytesNeeded. The client calls

RpcEnumPrinters and passes the allocated memory as a parameter.

4.  The server stores a printer information structure for each shared print queue in the output

buffer, stores the number of print information structures in the printersFound parameter, and
returns ERROR_SUCCESS.

If the number of shared print queues on the server has increased between the first and second
call to RpcEnumPrinters, the server also returns ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER from the
second call. In that case, the server updates the countBytesNeeded parameter so that the
client can reallocate the buffer and repeat the call to RpcEnumPrinters.

Task 2: Establishing a connection and registering for notifications

Figure 22: Print client submitting a print job to the print queue

The message group labeled "Submitting a print job and receiving notifications" in the preceding figure
shows how the client receives asynchronous notification of changes on a print queue and how it
submits a print job ([MS-RPRN] sections 3.1.4.9.1, 3.1.4.9.2, 3.1.4.9.3, 3.1.4.9.4, and 3.1.4.9.7).

The following steps describe task 3 of this example:

Asynchronously, and until the print server has finished processing the print job, the print server calls
the RpcRouterReplyPrinterEx method on the print client to notify the client of changes on the print
queue, such as job processing progress, status changes, or other changes.

33. The print client calls the RpcOpenPrinterEx method on the print server to open a handle to

the print queue for submitting a print job, and the print server returns a success code.

34. The print client calls the RpcStartDocPrinter method on the print server, and the print

server returns a job ID and a success code.

35. The print client calls the RpcStartPagePrinter method on the print server, and the print

server responds with a success code.

successive portions of the print job. The print server responds to each call with a success
code. This step is repeated until all the print data has been sent.

37. The print client calls the RpcEndPagePrinter method on the print server, and the print

server responds with a success code.

38. When all print data has been sent, the print client calls the RpcEndDocPrinter method on the

print server, and the print server responds with a success code.

3.3  Example 3: Receiving Unidirectional IHV-Defined Notifications

This example demonstrates the use cases described in section 2.5.3.7.1 Extension (b). In these cases,
the print client receives IHV-defined notifications from a manual duplex printer by using the Print
System Asynchronous Notification Protocol [MS-PAN]. These notifications are received after a print
queue has been located in a domain, a connection has been established, a print job has been
submitted by the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN] and the Print System Asynchronous

Remote Protocol [MS-PAR], and unidirectional IHV-defined communication has been established
between the print client and print server by using the Print System Asynchronous Notification Protocol.

Prerequisites

This example has the following prerequisites:<25>



The print client and print server support the Print System protocols.

  An IHV-defined print processor that is installed on the print server serves as the Print

System Asynchronous Notification Protocol as notification source and implements a Manual
Duplex operation. The operation prompts the user to walk up to the printer and reinsert
printed pages.











The print queue has been provisioned and is located on a print server in a domain.

The print server has published a list of the shared print queues to the Directory system.

The print client has located the print queue in the domain by using LDAP [RFC4511].

The printer driver is available from the print server.

The print client has established a connection, downloaded a driver, registered for notifications,
and submitted a print job, except that the asynchronous calls that are provided by the Print
System Asynchronous Remote Protocol have been used instead of the corresponding the Print
System Remote Protocol calls that were used in Example 1.

Initial System State

There are no specific initial system state requirements for this example other than those implied by
the prerequisites.

Final System State

The final system state is identical to the initial system state. This sequence of events leaves the
system state unmodified.

Sequence

Asynchronous communication: When the print client's notification listener thread receives a
notification that announces a new print job, the print client starts another listener thread to register
and listen for notifications. The following diagram shows the notification process that is based on the
Print System Asynchronous Notification Protocol.

Figure 24: Print client receiving notifications

The particular messages within the message groups that are shown in the preceding diagram are
described in [MS-PAN] section 4.2.

1.  During processing of the print job on the print server, the IHV-defined print processor sends
one or more notifications to the print client by using the Print System Asynchronous Remote
Protocol. The IHV-defined print processor can send these notifications at arbitrary times.

2.  When receiving the notification from the print server, the print client shows the user interface

to the user by displaying custom text provided by the IHV-defined print processor. The user
takes appropriate action and confirms the user interface.

3.  The print client sends a response by using the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol.

4.  The IHV-defined print processor takes appropriate actions that are based on the response that

was received from the print client.

It is common for print clients to listen for notifications from more than one thread. Therefore, the
steps for registration for notifications and unregistration can be observed on the network multiple
times.

An administrator with appropriate privileges can view and override print jobs that are submitted by
other users. This example illustrates this administrative procedure, by using only the Print System
Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN].

Prerequisites

This example has the following prerequisites:





The administrative client is used by an administrator who has privileges for overriding the
print operations of other users.

Either the print client or the print server supports the Print System Remote Protocol but not
the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR]. This precondition was chosen to
illustrate the use of the Print System Remote Protocol.<26>

section 3.1.4.3.1

1.  The administrative client calls the RpcOpenPrinterEx method on the print server to obtain

the handle for the print queue. The print server returns the print queue handle and a success
code.

2.  The administrative client calls the RpcEnumJobs method on the print server by using the
print queue handle. The print server enumerates all the print jobs that are assigned to that
print queue, and provides information about the print jobs, such as the names of the jobs, the
IDs of the jobs, and the names of the users who submitted the jobs, and returns a success
code.

3.  The administrative client displays the information about the print jobs. The administrator

selects the print jobs to cancel.

4.  The administrative client repeatedly calls the RpcSetJob method by running the

JOB_CONTROL_DELETE command on the print server that uses the print queue handle and
then by canceling one job at a time. The print server terminates each designated print job,
deleting it from the print queue and responding to each method call with a success code.

5.  The administrative client calls the RpcClosePrinter method on the print queue handle, and

the print server responds with a success code.

Final State

The print queue in this example contains only print jobs that were not deleted by the administrator.

3.5  Example 5: Provisioning a Print Queue By Using the Protocol Defined in [MS-

RPRN]

This example demonstrates the use case described in section 2.5.3.1 and section 2.5.3.2 under
variation (a) with extension (a), where a print queue is provisioned from an administrative client by
using the Print System Remote Protocol [MS-RPRN], and then the same print queue is deleted from a
different administrative client by using the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR].

In this example, two different administrative clients are involved in managing print queues: the first
client provisions a print queue, and the second client subsequently deletes the same print queue. The
first client uses the Print System Remote Protocol, and the second client uses the Print System
Asynchronous Remote Protocol. Although both management functions can be accomplished by either
protocol, this example demonstrates how the parallel functionality can be accomplished by using
different implementations or different versions of administrative clients.

The Windows-based administrative clients that are using the Print System Asynchronous Remote
Protocol to manage print queues first use the Print System Remote Protocol to ensure that the Print
System Asynchronous Remote Protocol is supported by the print server and that the print server is
available.

Prerequisites

This example has the following prerequisites:

  Administrative clients and print servers are located within a domain configuration.

  Administrative clients and print servers have access to the Active Directory system that is

provided by the domain.

3.6  Example 6: Sending a Print Job to an SMB Share

This example demonstrates the use cases described in sections 2.5.3.7.3 and 2.5.3.8.3.

This example involves the SMB protocol family [MS-SMB] and RAP [MS-RAP], supporting
interoperability with non-Windows platforms.<28> This example also applies to the rare case when a
Windows print client installs a local print queue with a local port specifying the UNC path of a shared
print queue on a print server.

In this example, when a user performs commands from a command prompt, the user is interacting
with the SMB Server Service installed on the print server. A user sends a print job to an SMB share
by entering the command copy /b file \\server\printer at a command prompt.<29> The print
client subsequently uses the SMB protocol family to copy the file to the specified SMB print share of
the print server. The SMB/RAP Print Redirector module (part of the SMB protocol family Server
Service) on the print server translates SMB calls from the print client to local calls to the print
subsystem of the print server.

After sending a print job to the SMB share of the print server, the user can obtain a list of the active
jobs on the specified print queue by entering net print \\server\printer at the command prompt.
The print client uses RAP to obtain the list of active jobs. The SMB/RAP Print Redirector module on the
print server translates the RAP calls from the print client to local calls to the print subsystem of the
print server.

Figure 28: Print client sending a print job to an SMB share

Message groups

Description

Copying print job data to
an SMB share

Using the SMB protocol, the print client copies print job data to an
SMB share for redirection to the print queue.

Obtaining job status

Using the RAP protocol, the print client obtains the status of the
print job.

References

[MS-SMB]

section 2.2

[MS-RAP]

section 3.2.5.5

The following steps describe this sequence.

1.  The print client calls the Create File method (SMB_COM_NT_CREATE_ANDX) on the print

server for the UNC name of the print queue.

2.  The SMB Server Service on the print server redirects the call to a local API of the print

spooler to open a handle to the print queue, and the local print spooler API returns the print
queue handle and a success code to the SMB Server Service.

3.  The SMB Server Service on the print server creates a wrapping structure in which to store the

print queue handle and starts the print job by invoking a local print spooler API.

4.  The SMB Server Service returns the handle of the wrapping structure and a success code to

the print client as though it were a file handle.

5.  The print client calls the method (SMB_COM_WRITE_ANDX) on the print server to submit

the print job data to the file handle.

6.  The SMB Server Service redirects the print job data to a local print spooler API using the print

queue handle stored in the wrapping structure, and the local print spooler API returns a
success code to the SMB Server Service.

7.  The SMB Server Service returns a success code to the print client.

8.  The print client ends the print job by calling the Close File method (SMB_COM_CLOSE) on

the SMB Server Service.

9.  The SMB Server Service calls a local print spooler API to close the print queue handle

designated in the wrapping structure, and the local print spooler API returns a success code to
the SMB Server Service.

10. The SMB Server Service frees the wrapping structure and then returns a success code to the

print client.

To then obtain information from the SMB Server Service about print job status, the user can enter the
net print command [MSFT-NETPRINT] at a command prompt, to which the print client responds as
follows.

11. The print client sends the NetPrintQGetInfo command defined by RAP to send the share

name of the print queue on the print server.

12. The SMB Server Service on the print server redirects the call to a local API of the print spooler

to obtain information about the jobs queued for the specified print queue, and the local print
spooler API returns job information and a success code.

13. The SMB Server Service responds to the NetPrintQGetInfo request with print job information

and a success code.

Final State

A new print job has been added to the print queue on the print server and is being sent to the
associated port.

<10> Section 2.6: This, behavior occurs in print clients implemented in Windows Client operating
system versions, except Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000 Professional operating system,
Windows Millennium Edition, and Windows XP.

<11> Section 2.7.1.1: Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows
2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 do not support
this configuration.

<12> Section 2.8.3: Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows Millennium
Edition, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and
Windows Server 2008 R2 implementations do not show this behavior.

<13> Section 2.9.1: This functionality is not supported on Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows 98,
and Windows Millennium Edition.

<14> Section 3.1: In Windows, print client implementations can satisfy this precondition by disabling
the PAR server endpoint on the print server, thus forcing the print server to use the Print System
Remote Protocol for communication with the print client. The PAR server endpoint on the print server
can be disabled through a registry setting on the print server. Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows
98, Windows 2000, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows XP, and Windows Vista implementations do
not show this behavior.

<15> Section 3.1: In Windows, the package aware flag can be set on the printer driver using the
registry key "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\<Environment
name>\Drivers\Version-3\<print driver name>\PrintDriverAttributes". This key can take the following
values:

Value

0x00000001

Description

The printer driver is part of a driver package.

PRINTER_DRIVER_PACKAGE_AWARE

and "Windows 4.0".

<16> Section 3.1: Print server support for the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR]
can be disabled by using a local Windows registry setting.

<17> Section 3.1: This precondition does not apply if the print client is implemented in Windows 95,
Windows 98, or Windows Millennium Edition.

<18> Section 3.1: The printer driver directory is not required by the Windows print client to
complete this scenario; the print client merely preemptively queries this piece of print server
configuration data.

<19> Section 3.1: After registering for print status notifications, Windows print clients call the
RpcRouterRefreshPrinterChangeNotification method on the print server with the dwColor
parameter value 1. The print server then returns the RpcRouterRefreshPrinterChangeNotification
method call with a success code.

Until a print client calls the RpcRouterRefreshPrinterChangeNotification method again with a
different dwColor parameter value, the Windows print server uses 1 as the dwColor parameter value
when calling the RpcReplyOpenPrinterEx method on the print client, as described in task 3 of this
example. Windows print clients and print servers use this mechanism to avoid order reversal of print
status notifications due to network latency.

<20> Section 3.2: The maximum number of shared print queues allowed in a Windows workgroup is
256.

<21> Section 3.2: Print server support for the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR]
can be disabled by using a local Windows registry setting.

<22> Section 3.2: This precondition does not apply if the print client is implemented in Windows 95,
Windows 98, or Windows Millennium Edition.

<23> Section 3.2: The printer driver directory is not required by Windows print clients to complete
this scenario. Print clients merely preemptively queries this piece of print server configuration data.

<24> Section 3.2: After registering for print status notifications, a Windows print client also calls the
RpcRouterRefreshPrinterChangeNotification method on the print server with the dwColor
parameter value 1. The print server then returns the RpcRouterRefreshPrinterChangeNotification
method call with a success code.

Until a Windows print client calls the RpcRouterRefreshPrinterChangeNotification method again
with a different dwColor parameter value, a Windows print server uses 1 as the dwColor parameter
value when calling the RpcReplyOpenPrinterEx method on the print client as described in task 3 of
this example. As described in [MS-RPRN], Windows print clients and print servers use this mechanism
to avoid order reversal of print status notifications due to network latency.

<25> Section 3.3: The example described in this section does not apply to print clients implemented
on Windows NT Workstation operating system, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000 Professional,
Windows Millennium Edition, and Windows XP, or to print servers implemented on Windows NT,
Windows 2000 Server operating system, and Windows Server 2003.

<26> Section 3.4: This precondition does not apply if the print client is implemented in Windows 95,
Windows 98, or Windows Millennium Edition. A registry setting is used to disable the Print System
Asynchronous Remote Protocol [MS-PAR].

<27> Section 3.5: This precondition does not apply if the administrative client is implemented in
Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium Edition. A registry setting is used to disable the
Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol.

## 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Directory Service Change Notification Protocol.
Queue managers own and store objects that are also stored in the directory service. When an
application makes changes to an object in the directory service, the MSMQ: Directory Service Change
Notification Protocol is used by the MSMQ Directory Service or by the queue manager to notify the
queue manager that owns the object that those changes have occurred. The types of notifications that
can be performed by using this protocol include notifying a queue manager that a queue object has
been created, changed, or deleted; and notifying a queue manager that its machine object has been
changed. The MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol is a queued protocol that uses
Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) as its transport infrastructure to send notifications wrapped
within MSMQ messages.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

### 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

Active Directory: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which

uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of
objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related
credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE]. Active Directory is either deployed as Active
Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS),
which are both described in [MS-ADOD]: Active Directory Protocols Overview.

Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF): A modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF),

commonly used by Internet specifications. ABNF notation balances compactness and simplicity
with reasonable representational power. ABNF differs from standard BNF in its definitions and
uses of naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. For more
information, see [RFC5234].

connected network: A network of computers in which any two computers can communicate

directly through a common transport protocol (for example, TCP/IP or SPX/IPX). A computer can
belong to multiple connected networks.

directory service (DS): An entity that maintains a collection of objects. These objects can be

remotely manipulated either by the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Directory Service Protocol, as
specified in [MS-MQDS], or by the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3), as specified in
[RFC2251].

domain controller (DC): The service, running on a server, that implements Active Directory, or
the server hosting this service. The service hosts the data store for objects and interoperates
with other DCs to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across all DCs.
When Active Directory is operating as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), the DC
contains full NC replicas of the configuration naming context (config NC), schema naming
context (schema NC), and one of the domain NCs in its forest. If the AD DS DC is a global
catalog server (GC server), it contains partial NC replicas of the remaining domain NCs in its
forest. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5.2 and [MS-ADTS]. When
Active Directory is operating as Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS),
several AD LDS DCs can run on one server. When Active Directory is operating as AD DS, only
one AD DS DC can run on one server. However, several AD LDS DCs can coexist with one AD
DS DC on one server. The AD LDS DC contains full NC replicas of the config NC and the schema
NC in its forest. The domain controller is the server side of Authentication Protocol Domain
Support [MS-APDS].

enterprise: A unit of administration of a network of MSMQ queue managers. An enterprise

consists of an MSMQ Directory Service, one or more connected networks, and one or more
MSMQ sites.

globally unique identifier (GUID): A term used interchangeably with universally unique

identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of
these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value.
Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in
[RFC4122] or [C706] have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique
identifier (UUID).

little-endian: Multiple-byte values that are byte-ordered with the least significant byte stored in

the memory location with the lowest address.

message: A data structure representing a unit of data transfer between distributed applications. A
message has message properties, which can include message header properties, a message
body property, and message trailer properties.

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ): A communications service that provides asynchronous

and reliable message passing between distributed applications. In Message Queuing,
applications send messages to queues and consume messages from queues. The queues
provide persistence of the messages, enabling the sending and receiving applications to
operate asynchronously from one another.

MSMQ Directory Service: A network directory service that provides directory information,

including key distribution, to MSMQ. It initially shipped in the Windows NT 4.0 operating system
Option Pack for Windows NT Server as part of MSMQ. This directory service predates and is
superseded by Active Directory (AD).

MSMQ management server: A role played by an MSMQ queue manager. An MSMQ

management server enables management applications to perform management and
administrative operations on the Message Queuing System. The Management Server operations
are specified in [MS-MQMR] and [MS-MQCN].

MSMQ queue manager: An MSMQ service hosted on a machine that provides queued messaging

services. Queue managers manage queues deployed on the local computer and provide
asynchronous transfer of messages to queues located on other computers. A queue manager
is identified by a globally unique identifier (GUID).

MSMQ routing link: A communication link between two sites. A routing link is represented by a

routing link object in the directory service. Routing links can have associated link costs. Routing
links with their associated costs can be used to compute lowest-cost routing paths for store-and-
forward messaging.

MSMQ routing server: A role played by an MSMQ queue manager. An MSMQ routing server
implements store and forward messaging. A routing server can provide connectivity between
different connected networks within a site or can provide session concentration between sites.

MSMQ site: A network of computers, typically physically collocated, that have high connectivity as
measured in terms of latency (low) and throughput (high). A site is represented by a site object
in the directory service. An MSMQ site maps one-to-one with an Active Directory site when
Active Directory provides directory services to MSMQ.

notification queue: A private Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) queue to which

notifications are sent and from which notifications are received.

public queue: An application-defined message queue that is registered in the MSMQ Directory

Service. A public queue can be deployed at any queue manager.

queue: An object that holds messages passed between applications or messages passed

between Message Queuing and applications. In general, applications can send messages to
queues and read messages from queues.

queue manager (QM): A message queuing service that manages queues deployed on a

computer. A queue manager can also provide asynchronous transfer of messages to queues
deployed on other queue managers.

Unicode character: Unless otherwise specified, a 16-bit UTF-16 code unit.

Unicode string: A Unicode 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a Unicode 16-bit
string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an ordered
sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a
terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all Unicode strings follow the UTF-16LE
encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

workgroup mode: A Message Queuing deployment mode in which the clients and servers operate
without using a Directory Service. In this mode, features pertaining to message security,
efficient routing, queue discovery, distribution lists, and aliases are not available. See also
Directory-Integrated mode.

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

[MS-MQOD] Microsoft Corporation, "Message Queuing Protocols Overview".

### 1.3 Overview

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) is a communications service that provides asynchronous and
reliable message passing between client applications running on different hosts. In MSMQ, clients
send application messages to queues and consume application messages from queues. The queue
provides persistence of the messages, enabling them to survive across application restarts, and
allowing the sending and receiving client applications to send and receive messages asynchronously
from each other.

Queues are typically hosted by a communications service called a queue manager. By hosting the
queue manager in a separate service from the client applications, applications can communicate (even
if they never execute at the same time) by exchanging messages via a queue hosted by the queue
manager.

Because MSMQ involves message passing between nodes, a directory service can be useful to MSMQ
services in several ways. First, a directory service can provide network topology information that the
MSMQ services can use to route messages between nodes. Second, a directory service can be used as
a key distribution mechanism for security services used by MSMQ to secure messages and to
authenticate clients. Third, a directory service can provide clients with discovery capabilities, allowing
clients to discover the queues available within the network. Finally, a directory service can contain
collections of directory objects representing enterprises, MSMQ sites, routing links, machines,
users, queues, connected networks, and deleted objects.

In MSMQ, queue and machine objects can be created, changed, and deleted in a directory service. As
a result, the internal state of the queue manager that is the owner of these objects is left out of sync.
In MSMQ, a queue manager is notified when one of its owned objects is changed in a directory
service.

The MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol defines a mechanism used by the MSMQ
Directory Service or a queue manager to notify a queue manager of changes to its owned objects.
The types of notifications that can be performed by using this protocol include notifying a queue
manager that a queue object has been created, changed, or deleted; and notifying a queue manager
that its machine object has been changed.

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol is a queued protocol that uses the
Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ): Message Queuing Binary Protocol [MS-MQQB] as its
transport protocol.

 The MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol uses shared state and processing rules
defined in [MS-MQDMPR].

### 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

It is assumed that the protocol client has obtained the name of a server computer that supports this
protocol and the name of the notification queue hosted on the server before this protocol is invoked.

Message Queuing (MSMQ): Directory Service Change Notification Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


How a client acquires this information is not addressed in this specification and is typically part of the
interaction between the client application and the queue manager API.

It is assumed that the protocol client has access to a private encryption key used to decrypt
messages. A private key is typically stored in a secure location on the local client machine.

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

The server side of this protocol is applicable for implementation by a queue manager providing
Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) communication services to clients. The client side of this
protocol is applicable for implementation by client libraries providing message queue managers to
applications by directory service or by a queue manager delegating requests on behalf of a
client.<1> This protocol is applicable to scenarios where a queue manager that is the owner of public
queue objects or a machine object needs to be notified when these objects are changed in a directory
service or on another queue manager on behalf of a client.<2> This protocol is not applicable to
objects that are not stored in a directory service, such as private queues. This protocol is not
applicable for distributed applications that require notification messages within a predefined amount of
time. Notification messages are sent and, once received, the destination queue manager schedules act
on them at specific time intervals.<3>

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

  Supported Transports: This protocol is implemented on top of MSMQ, as specified in section 2.1.
It relies on MSMQ message sending and receiving mechanisms to send and receive notifications
as messages.

  Capability Negotiation: This protocol has explicit capability negotiation that depends on the version

of the notification message. There are two notification message versions. Version 1 is for
messages sent by an MSMQ Directory Service, and version 2 is for messages sent by a queue
manager.<4>

### 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol does not define any vendor-extensible fields.

### 1.9 Standards Assignments

This section specifies standard parameters within the context of MSMQ.

#### 2.2.5 Notification Body

A Notification Body is used to encapsulate a change notification that indicates a change either on a
queue or a machine object within a directory service. The change is expressed as a notification
event that indicates one of the following events: creation of a queue object, change on a queue
object, deletion of a queue object, or change on a machine object. A Notification Body is used by a
queue manager to send a change notification message to the queue manager that is the owner of
the modified object. This format does not include the changed data. The recipient queue manager
MUST read the data from the directory service, as specified in section 3.2.5.2; therefore, queue
managers do not have to be trusted.

<Notification>

<Event>Event</Event>

<ObjectGuid>ObjectGuid</ObjectGuid>

<DomainController>DirectoryServiceServer</DomainController>

</Notification>

Event

Specifies the notification event for a queue or a machine object on which changes were made within a
domain controller (DC). This MUST be set to 1, 2, 3, or 4. A value of 1 indicates creation of a queue
object. A value of 2 indicates change on a queue object; a value of 3 indicates deletion of a queue
object. A value of 4 indicates change on a machine object.

ObjectGuid

Specifies the object that was modified within the DC. This MUST be set to the GUID of the modified
object that MUST be either a queue or a machine object.

DirectoryServiceServer

Specifies the name of the Directory Service server through which the queue or the machine object was
modified in the directory.

Notification body MUST be set to a Unicode string in the format specified by the following
Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) rule.

 NotificationBody =     "<Notification>"
                        "<Event>"event"</Event>"

#### 2.2.6 Notification Update

A Notification Update is used to encapsulate a change notification that indicates a change either on
a queue or a machine object within a directory service. The change is expressed as a notification
event that indicates one of the following events: creation of a queue object, change on a queue
object, deletion of a queue object, or change on a machine object. A Notification Update is used by
a directory service to send change notification messages to the queue manager that is the owner of
the modified objects.

UseGuid (1 byte): A UCHAR that indicates whether a Notification Update uses the PathName or
the GuidIdentifier field. This field MUST be set to 0x01 to indicate that the GuidIdentifier field
is being used. Otherwise, this field MUST be set to 0x00 to indicate that the PathName field is
being used.

Value  Meaning

0x00

The PathName field is being used.

0x01

The GuidIdentifier field is being used.

PathName (variable): Indicates the path of the object that was modified in the directory service.

MUST be a null-terminated Unicode string, and MUST follow the rules specified in
PROPID_Q_PATHNAME ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.3.1.3). This field MUST NOT be present if the
UseGuid field is set to 0x01. Instead, the GuidIdentifier field MUST be set with a value.

GuidIdentifier (16 bytes): Indicates the GUID of the object that was modified in the directory

service. This field MUST be present if the UseGuid field is set to 0x01.

GuidMasterId (16 bytes): Indicates the GUID of the directory server that originated the change

Notification Update.

Reserved (24 bytes): A 24-byte array of UCHAR reserved for future use. MAY be set to all 0x00

bytes by the client, and MUST be ignored by the server.

NumberOfProperties (1 byte): A UCHAR that indicates the number of properties that are included

as part of this Notification Update.

PropertyId (variable): An array of PROPID that contains a collection of property IDs that are part of
this Notification Update. These properties refer either to informative data or to changed data
related to the changed object. The number of elements MUST be equal to the value of the
NumberOfProperties field.

PropertyValue (variable): Contains a collection of property values that are part of this Notification

Update. These instances contain either informative data or modified data related to the changed
object. The number of property values MUST be equal to the value of the NumberOfProperties
field. The format of each property value depends on the variant type, which is determined by the
corresponding property ID. Section 2.2.3 lists the formats for the variant types. Sections 2.2.3.1
through 2.2.3.15 define the types for each property ID.

### 2.3 Directory Service Schema Elements

This protocol uses ADM elements specified in section 3.1.1. A subset of these elements can be
published in a directory. This protocol SHOULD<6> access the directory using the algorithm specified

### 3.2 MQCN Server Details

#### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation
maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the
explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations
adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this
document.

The abstract data model for this protocol comprises ADM elements that are private to this protocol and
others that are shared between multiple MSMQ protocols that are collocated at a common queue
manager. The shared abstract data model is defined in [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1, and the
relationship between this protocol, a queue manager, and other protocols that share a queue manager
is described in [MS-MQOD].

Section 3.2.1.1 references the ADM elements from the shared data model that are manipulated by this
protocol.

Section 3.2.1.2 describes the ADM elements that are specific to the server side of this protocol.

##### 3.2.1.1 Shared Data Elements

The server side of this protocol manipulates the shared ADM elements listed in section 3.1.1.1.

##### 3.2.1.2 Local Data Elements

In addition to the shared ADM elements, the server side of this protocol manipulates the Change
Notification Queue (section 3.2.1.2.1) ADM element.

###### 3.2.1.2.1 Change Notification Queue

The Change Notification Queue ADM element represents a local private notification queue. The
following ABNF rule specifies the queue name format.

 QueuePathName = (Computer "\private$\notify_queue$")
 Computer      = 1*256(VCHAR) ; computer where the queue manager resides
 VCHAR         = %x21-7E

#### 3.2.2 Timers

None.

#### 3.2.3 Initialization

The implementation of this protocol SHOULD<8> open the local private change notification queue.
This queue MUST be opened by raising an Open Queue ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.7.1.5) event with
the following arguments:







iFormatName := NOTIFY_QUEUE_PRIVATE as defined in section 1.9.

iRequiredAccess := ReceiveAccess.

iSharedMode := DenyNone.

This event returns rStatus and rOpenQueueDescriptor. If rStatus is MQ_OK, the value of
rOpenQueueDescriptor is stored for reuse when dequeuing messages from this queue. Otherwise, if
rStatus is different than MQ_OK, this protocol cannot work correctly.

After the change notification queue is open, the implementation MUST start a loop for the lifetime of
the server side of this protocol for dequeuing and processing change notification messages:

  Raise the Dequeue Message ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.7.1.10) event with the following

arguments:



iQueueDesc := The OpenQueueDescriptor ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.16) ADM element
instance referenced by rOpenQueueDescriptor returned by the Open Queue event that opened
the change notification queue.

This event returns rMessage, a reference to the Message ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.12) ADM
element instance that was dequeued.

#### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

#### 3.2.5 Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The server MUST initialize the local private change notification queue as specified in section 3.2.3.
When a Dequeue Message ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.7.1.10) event is raised, the server MUST
process the returned rMessage as follows:



Let NotificationMessage be initialized to rMessage.Body parsed as a Change Notification
Message (section 2.2.4).

  Verify the value of the NotificationMessage.Version field, and:



If the value of the NotificationMessage.Version field is 0x01, the NotificationMessage.Data
field MUST be interpreted as an array of instances of Notification Update (section 2.2.6). The
number of instances is determined by the value of the
NotificationMessage.NumberOfUpdateNotifications field. For receiving a change notification
message version 0x01, see section 3.2.5.1.

  Otherwise, if the value of the NotificationMessage.Version field is 0x02, the

NotificationMessage.Data field MUST be interpreted as an instance of Notification
Body (section 2.2.5). For receiving a change notification message version 0x02, see section
3.2.5.2.

After a notification message is processed, another Dequeue Message event MUST be generated as
specified in section 3.2.3. This process is repeated for the lifetime of the queue manager.

##### 3.2.5.1 Processing a Change Notification Message Version 0x01

For a Change Notification Message (section 2.2.4) with a Version field set to 0x01,
NotificationMessage.Data is an array of Notification Updates (section 2.2.6). For each Notification
Update in the array, the server MUST update the state of the queue or queue manager object
referenced by the PathName field or the GuidIdentifier field.

To process the update, the server MUST perform the following steps for each Notification Update in
the array:



The queue manager MUST verify that the change notification Message ([MS-MQDMPR] section
3.1.1.12) ADM element instance rMessage was authenticated, according to the following rules:





If rMessage.SenderIdentifierType does not equal QueueManagerIdentifier, the server
MUST disregard the Change Notification Message and perform no further processing.

If rMessage.AuthenticationLevel has a value of 0x0 (None), the server MUST disregard the
Change Notification Message and perform no further processing.



The object type (either a queue object or a queue manager object) in a Notification Update
MUST be determined according to the following rules:



If the Command field is set to 0x00 (created) or 0x01 (updated), the server MUST perform
the following actions:







If the value of PropertyId[0] is greater than 1,000, the object type MUST be set to
(PropertyId[0] - 1,000) / 100.

If the value of PropertyId[0] is less than or equal to 1,000, the object type MUST be set
to PropertyId[0] / 100.

If the object type does not equal 1 (a queue object) or 2 (a queue manager object), the
server MUST disregard the Change Notification Message and perform no further
processing.

  Once the object type is identified, the following actions MUST be performed:



If the Command field equals 0x00 (created) and object type is 1 (a queue object), the
following processing rules MUST be performed:



Let newQueue be a new Queue ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.2) ADM element instance.

  Raise a Set Queue Defaults ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.7.1.33) event with the following

arguments:



iQueue := newQueue

  Set the following ADM attributes on the Queue ADM element instance newQueue:

  Type := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_TYPE) ]



Identifier := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_INSTANCE) ]

  BasePriority := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_BASEPRIORITY) ]



Journaling := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_JOURNAL) ]

  Quota := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_QUOTA) ]

  Scope := PropertyValue [ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_SCOPE) ]

  Raise a Create Queue ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.7.1.3) event with the following

arguments:





iQueue := newQueue.

iSkipDirectory := True.



If the Command field equals 0x01 (updated) and object type is 1 (a queue object), the
following processing rules MUST be performed:

  Update the corresponding ADM attributes in the Queue ADM element instance in the
QueueCollection ADM attribute of the local QueueManager ([MS-MQDMPR] section
3.1.1.1) ADM element instance with the following values:

  BasePriority := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_BASEPRIORITY) ]



Journal := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_JOURNAL) ]

  Quota := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_QUOTA) ]



JournalQuota := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_JOURNAL_QUOTA) ]

  Security := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_SECURITY) ]

  Authentication := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_AUTHENTICATE) ]

  PrivacyLevel := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_Q_PRIV_LEVEL) ]

All other PROPIDs are not used, and they MUST be ignored.



If the Command field equals 0x01 (updated) and object type is 2 (a queue manager object),
the following processing rules MUST be performed:

  Update the following ADM attributes of the local QueueManager ADM element instance

with the following values:

  QueueManagerQuota := PropertyValue[ IndexOf(PROPID_QM_QUOTA) ]



arguments:



iQueue := A reference to the Queue ADM element instance from the
QueueCollection ADM attribute of the local QueueManager ADM element instance
whose identifier is equal to the GuidIdentifier field.



iSkipDirectory := True.

Section 3.2.1 specifies the abstract data model that can be used as a reference to maintain data
specific to Queue and QueueManager ADM element instances in a queue manager that implements
this protocol.

##### 3.2.5.2 Processing a Change Notification Message Version 0x02

For a Change Notification Message (section 2.2.4) with a Version field set to 0x02,
NotificationMessage.Data is a Notification Body (section 2.2.5). The server MUST update the state of
the queue or machine object referenced by the GUID contained in ObjectGuid. If the value contained
in Event indicates creation or update, the queue manager MUST request information from the
directory service specified within DomainController for the updating process, as specified in [MS-
MQDMPR].

The following actions MUST be performed upon the reception of a notification message:



 If Event is set to 1 (create queue), the following processing rules MUST be performed:

indicate that a machine object was changed.<10> The ObjectGuid token MUST contain the GUID of
the queue or the machine object that was changed. The DomainController token MUST contain the
directory service name where the queue or a machine object was changed.

The Change Notification Message MUST be created as follows: The Version field MUST be set to
0x02. The NumberOfUpdateNotifications field MUST be set to 0x01 to indicate that there is only
one update notification in the notification message. A queue manager MUST send only one
notification message at a time. The Data field MUST be filled with the Notification Body instance
created as specified in this section.

Finally, the Change Notification Message MUST be included within a Message ([MS-MQDMPR]
section 3.1.1.12) ADM element instance and MUST be sent through MSMQ to the destination queue
manager, as specified in section 3.3.5.3.

##### 3.3.5.2 Preparing a Change Notification Message Version 0x01

Notification Updates (section 2.2.6) as follows:















The Command field MUST be set to 0x00 to indicate that a queue object was created in the
directory service; or it MUST be set to 0x01 to indicate that a queue or machine object was
updated; or it MUST be set to 0x02 to indicate that a queue object was deleted.

The UseGuid field MUST be set to 0x00 if the Command field is set to 0x00 to indicate that the
PathName field is being used. For other values of the Command field, the UseGuid field MUST
be set to 0x01 to indicate that the GuidIdentifier field is being used.

The PathName field MUST be set to a null-terminated value if the UseGuid field is set to 0x00
and MUST be omitted if the UseGuid field is set to 0x01.

If the UseGuid field is set to 0x01, the GuidIdentifier field MUST be set to the GUID of either
the queue object or the machine object that was changed.

The GuidMasterId field MUST be set to the GUID of the directory service that originated the
change notification message.

The NumberOfProperties field MUST be set to the number of properties contained within each
Notification Update.

## 4 Protocol Examples

### 4.1 Management Client Update Profile

This example describes how an application can create a public queue on a remote queue manager.
The application profile consists of the MSMQ Directory Service and two MSMQ management
servers. Both MSMQ management servers can access the MSMQ Directory Service. The following
steps show how an application can create a public queue on a remote machine.

Figure 1: Creation of a public queue on a remote queue manager

1.  An application on System 1 requests that a public queue be created on System 3. Microsoft

Message Queuing (MSMQ) first notifies the MSMQ Directory Service and updates it by creating
a queue object. This update can happen in two ways:





This request can be made directly through the MSMQ runtime. This communication is
facilitated over the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Directory Service Protocol [MS-MQDS] for
MSMQ Version 1 and over Active Directory, as specified in [MS-ADTS], for MSMQ Version 2,
onward.

If the runtime is unable to create the object, the request is handed to the local queue
manager. In this case, the queue manager on System 1 updates the MSMQ Directory Service
using the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Directory Service Protocol or Active Directory.

2.  The actual creation of the public queue is handled via the queue manager on System 3. The queue

manager is notified via the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Directory Service Change Notification
Protocol; however, the initiation of this protocol depends on the version of MSMQ and the
directory service.



If MSMQ Version 1.0 directory service is running, the MSMQ Directory Service informs the
queue manager via the MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol, as shown in
arrow 2.a.



If Active Directory is used, the queue manager on System 1 informs the queue manager on
System 3 via the MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol, as shown in arrow
2.b.

## 5 Security

### 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

This protocol might allow denial-of-service (DoS) attacks to the server. An implementation of this
protocol has to develop mechanisms to prevent such attacks. One of these mechanisms is to process
notifications only every few minutes.<14>

### 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

  Windows Server 2025 operating system

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base
(KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior
also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the
product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed
using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the
SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the
product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.6: On Windows NT and Windows 2000, the MSMQ Directory Service notifies the
destination queue manager via the MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol. On all
other Windows implementations of this protocol, the local queue manager notifies the destination
queue manager via the MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol. If an MSMQ routing
server is enabled, the path that the message takes between the local queue manager and the
destination queue manager can be altered, as indicated in [MS-MQBR].

<2> Section 1.6: On Windows NT and Windows 2000, the MSMQ Directory Service notifies the
destination queue manager via the MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol. On all other
Windows implementations of this protocol, the local queue manager notifies the destination queue
manager via the MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol. If an MSMQ routing server is
enabled, the path that the message takes between the local queue manager and the destination
queue manager can be altered, as indicated in [MS-MQBR].

<3> Section 1.6: On Windows NT and Windows 2000, queue managers process notification
messages as soon as they arrive. On all other Windows implementations of this protocol, notification
messages are delayed by up to 15 minutes to prevent denial-of-service attacks. If the last change
notification message was processed more than 14 minutes ago, the queue manager sets a timer for
one minute and waits for additional change notification messages to arrive. If the last change
notification message was processed 14 or less minutes ago, the timer is set for the remainder of the
15 minutes instead of one minute. When the timer expires, the queue manager processes all received
change notification messages. If 100 or more change notification messages arrive while the queue
manager is waiting for the timer to expire, it ignores the messages and instead updates the state of all
the public queue objects that it owns with the state of those objects that is stored in the directory
service (as described in section 3.2.5.2 for a change queue event) when the timer expires.

<4> Section 1.7: On Windows NT and Windows 2000, queue managers process messages only from
the directory service. Other messages are ignored. On all other Windows implementations of this
protocol, queue managers process messages either from the directory service or from queue
managers. Other messages are ignored.

<5> Section 2.2.4: On Windows NT and Windows 2000, the MSMQ Directory Service notifies the
destination queue manager via the MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol. On all other
Windows implementations of this protocol, the local queue manager notifies the destination queue
manager via the MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol. If an MSMQ routing server is
enabled, the path that the message takes between the local queue manager and the destination
queue manager can be altered, as indicated in [MS-MQBR].

<6> Section 2.3: For Windows NT and Windows 2000, this protocol uses the Message Queuing
(MSMQ): Directory Service Protocol [MS-MQDS].

<7> Section 2.3: For the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Directory Service Protocol [MS-MQDS], the
Directory Service schema elements are described in [MS-MQDS] sections 2.2.10 and 3.1.4.21.1
through 3.1.4.21.4.

<8> Section 3.2.3: On Windows implementations of this protocol, except for Windows NT, Windows
2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, when a queue manager is running in workgroup
mode, the notification queue is not created, and the protocol is not initialized.

<9> Section 3.3.4.1: On Windows NT and Windows 2000, the MSMQ Directory Service notifies the
destination queue manager via the MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol. On all other
Windows implementations of this protocol, the local queue manager notifies the destination queue
manager via the MSMQ: Directory Service Change Notification Protocol. If an MSMQ routing server is
enabled, the path that the message takes between the local queue manager and the destination
queue manager can be altered, as described in the Binary Reliable Message Routing Algorithm [MS-
MQBR].

<10> Section 3.3.5.1: On all Windows versions, if a message is received and the value of the Event
token is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, the message is ignored.

<11> Section 3.3.5.2: For a Change Notification Message (section 2.2.4) with a Version field set to
0x01, the Windows implementation of the Client side of MQCN sends additional properties that are
ignored by the Server side of MQCN. This action is performed because the Windows implementation
takes the data structure used in the directory service and passes it as is, without removing the
additional or unnecessary properties.

<12> Section 3.3.5.3: MSMQ versions 1 and 2 use MD5, as specified in [RFC1321]; versions 2 and 4
use SHA1, as specified in [RFC3110].

<13> Section 3.3.5.3: MSMQ version 1 sets this value to Sig10.

<14> Section 5.1: On Windows NT and Windows 2000, queue managers process notification
messages as soon as they arrive. On all other Windows implementations of this protocol, notification
messages are delayed by up to 15 minutes to prevent denial-of-service attacks. If the last change
notification message was processed more than 14 minutes ago, the queue manager sets a timer for 1
minute and waits for additional change notification messages to arrive. When the timer expires, the
queue manager processes all received change notification messages and clears the timer. If 100 or
more change notification messages arrive while the queue manager is waiting for the timer to expire,
it ignores the messages and instead refreshes all public queues when the timer expires. If the last
change notification message was processed 14 or fewer minutes ago, the timer is set for the
remainder of the 15 minutes instead of 1 minute.

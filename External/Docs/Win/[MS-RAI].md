## 1 Introduction

The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol is a set of Distributed Component Object Model
(DCOM) interfaces, as specified in [MS-DCOM], for initiating a Remote Assistance connection to
another computer in a domain. The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol allows an authorized
expert to start Remote Assistance on a remote novice computer to retrieve data that is required to
make a Remote Assistance connection from the expert computer to the novice computer.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

### 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

class identifier (CLSID): A GUID that identifies a software component; for instance, a DCOM

object class or a COM class.

computer name: The DNS or NetBIOS name.

Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM): The Microsoft Component Object Model (COM)
specification that defines how components communicate over networks, as specified in [MS-
DCOM].

domain: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management

infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller (DC)
and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting
the Active Directory service. The domain controller provides authentication of members, creating
a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its members.
For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS].

domain name: A domain name or a NetBIOS name that identifies a domain.

expert: The side of a Remote Assistance connection that is able to view the remote screen of

the other computer in order to provide help.

fully qualified domain name (FQDN): An unambiguous domain name that gives an absolute

location in the Domain Name System's (DNS) hierarchy tree, as defined in [RFC1035] section
3.1 and [RFC2181] section 11.

novice: The side of a Remote Assistance connection that shares its screen with the other

computer in order to receive help.

opnum: An operation number or numeric identifier that is used to identify a specific remote

procedure call (RPC) method or a method in an interface. For more information, see [C706]
section 12.5.2.12 or [MS-RPCE].

Remote Assistance (RA): A feature of the operating system that allows screen, keyboard, and

mouse sharing so that a computer user can be assisted by a remote helper.

Remote Assistance connection: A communication framework that is established between two

computers that facilitates Remote Assistance.

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): A multi-channel protocol that allows a user to connect to a
computer running Microsoft Terminal Services (TS). RDP enables the exchange of client and
server settings and also enables negotiation of common settings to use for the duration of the
connection, so that input, graphics, and other data can be exchanged and processed between
client and server.

Release: April 23, 2024


remote procedure call (RPC): A communication protocol used primarily between client and

server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime
environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set
of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the
single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message).  For more information, see [C706].

terminal services (TS): A service on a server computer that allows delivery of applications, or

the desktop itself, to various computing devices. When a user runs an application on a terminal
server, the application execution takes place on the server computer and only keyboard, mouse,
and display information is transmitted over the network. Each user sees only his or her
individual session, which is managed transparently by the server operating system and is
independent of any other client session.

Unicode string: A Unicode 8-bit string is an ordered sequence of 8-bit units, a Unicode 16-bit
string is an ordered sequence of 16-bit code units, and a Unicode 32-bit string is an ordered
sequence of 32-bit code units. In some cases, it could be acceptable not to terminate with a
terminating null character. Unless otherwise specified, all Unicode strings follow the UTF-16LE
encoding scheme with no Byte Order Mark (BOM).

universally unique identifier (UUID): A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple

purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very
persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager
entry-point vectors, and RPC objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also
known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the
Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not
imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of
this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [RFC4122] or [C706] has to
be used for generating the UUID.

well-known endpoint: A preassigned, network-specific, stable address for a particular

client/server instance. For more information, see [C706].

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

### 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the
most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents
in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not
match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the Errata.

### 1.3 Overview

The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol provides a set of DCOM interfaces that enable an expert to
retrieve the Remote Assistance connection-specific data from the remote novice computer. This
Remote Assistance connection-specific data is subsequently used to initiate a Remote Assistance
connection as explained in the Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol.

The expert needs to have the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the novice
computer to use this protocol.

The expert is the DCOM client and the novice is the DCOM server.

 Before the expert's DCOM call is executed on the novice computer, DCOM performs a check to verify
that the expert is on the list of authorized Remote Assistance helpers on the novice computer.<1>

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol relies on the OLE Automation Protocol [MS-OAUT], the
Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol [MS-DCOM], and on the Microsoft
remote procedure call (RPC), as specified in the Remote Procedure Call Protocol Extensions [MS-
RPCE].

The Remote Assistance Protocol [MS-RA] is dependent on both the Remote Assistance Initiation
Protocol and the Remote Desktop Protocol: Basic Connectivity and Graphics Remoting [MS-RDPBCGR].

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the preceding protocols.

### 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

This protocol is implemented over DCOM and RPC, and, as a result, has the prerequisites specified in
the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol [MS-DCOM] and Remote Procedure
Call Protocol Extensions [MS-RPCE] as being common to DCOM and RPC interfaces.

The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol assumes that the expert has the IP Address or the FQDN of
the novice computer.

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol is used to perform the following functions:

  Using the novice IP address or FQDN, the expert queries the novice for a list of active terminal
services sessions running on the novice computer. Additional information about each terminal
services session—DomainName, UserName, terminal services SessionID, and terminal services
SessionState—is also obtained.

  Using the DomainName, UserName, and SessionID of a specific session on the novice computer,

the expert queries the novice for a Remote Assistance Connection String. The novice starts
Remote Assistance and returns a Remote Assistance Connection String. The novice is now
waiting for the expert to make a peer-to-peer connection to its terminal services session.

  After a Remote Assistance Connection String is obtained by the expert, it is used to make a peer-
to-peer Remote Assistance connection to the novice's Terminal Service session on the novice
computer.

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas.

Supported Transports: This protocol uses the DCOM  technology specified in [MS-DCOM], which
provides capabilities to query for interface versions.

Protocol Versions: This protocol is composed of the following two primary DCOM interfaces, which
are version 0.0:<2>





IPCHService

IRASrv

Both these interfaces offer similar functionality through their methods. An RPC client determines if a
method is supported by attempting to invoke the method; if the method is not supported, the RPC
server returns the "RPC_S_PROCNUM_OUT_OF_RANGE" error, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section
3.1.1.5.5.

When an expert attempts to connect using this protocol, it uses only one of these two interfaces.

The novice computer implements at least one of these two interfaces, and can implement both
interfaces.

The expert computer negotiates for a given set of server functionality by specifying the UUID
corresponding to the wanted RPC interface when binding to the novice.

### 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol does not define any vendor-extensible fields.

### 2.1 Transport

DCOM [MS-DCOM] is used as the transport protocol. The Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol
documented here relies upon DCOM [MS-DCOM] authentication and encryption for all protocol
messages.

This protocol MUST use these universally unique identifier (UUID) interfaces, as explained in
section 1.9:

### 2.2 Common Data Types

In addition to RPC base types and definitions specified in [C706] and [MS-DTYP], additional data
types are defined in the following sections.

There are two version-specific forms of the Remote Assistance Connection String, appended with 1
and 2 to differentiate them.

#### 2.2.1 Remote Assistance Connection String 1

The Remote Assistance Connection String 1 contains the Remote Desktop Protocol parameters to
establish a Remote Assistance connection. The Remote Assistance Connection String 1 is a
comma-delimited Unicode string comprising the following pieces of data.<3>

 <ProtocolVersion>,<protocolType>,<machineAddressList>,<assistantAccountPwd>,
 <RASessionID>,<RASessionName>,<RASessionPwd>,<protocolSpecificParms>

The elements are defined as follows.

ProtocolVersion: Identifies the protocol version. The value MUST be 65,538.

protocolType: Identifies the protocol type. The value MUST be 1.

machineAddressList: Identifies network address of server machine. It is a semicolon-delimited list of

IPAddress(or computer name):PortID string pairs. The IPAddress is of type IPV4.

assistantAccountPwd: Password for Remote Assistance Account Name. This MUST be set to "*".

RASessionID: Remote Assistance session unique identifier.

RASessionName: Remote Assistance session name. This MUST be set to "*".

Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


RASessionPwd: Remote Assistance session password. This MUST be set to "*".

protocolSpecificParms: Parameter specific to a Remote Desktop Protocol.

The following is an example of Remote Assistance Connection String 1.

 65538,1,172.31.243.138:3389;MIKE_HOME:3389,*,Uj7RpOlU80SibpRw
 RZ9+z1vbh7nIgVn89X1AiKp15Vc=,*,*,RcfwecK8dpcT1fjZ6iQ5M0+q7iU=

The values for the Remote Assistance Connection String 1 entities in the preceding example are as
follows.

 ProtocolVersion =  65538
 protocolType = 1
 machineAddressList = 172.31.243.138:3389;MIKE_HOME:3389
 assistantAccountPwd = *
 RASessionID = Uj7RpOlU80SibpRwRZ9+z1vbh7nIgVn89X1AiKp15Vc=
 RASessionName = *
 RASessionPwd = *
 protocolSpecificParms = RcfwecK8dpcT1fjZ6iQ5M0+q7iU=

#### 2.2.2 Remote Assistance Connection String 2

The second type of the Remote Assistance Connection String packet is a Unicode string in XML
format.<4> The details of this are as follows.

 <E>
     <A KH="Protocol-specific Parameter" KH2="Protocol-specific Parameter" ID="Authorization
String Identifier" />
     <C>
         <T ID="Transport ID" SID="Session ID">
               <L P="Port" N="Server Name" />
         </T>
     </C>
 </E>

The novice (server) generates the KH attribute of the Auth String Node <A> in the Remote Assistance
Connection String 2. The expert (client) validates the value of KH during the RDP connection
sequence.

The KH value is a base64-encoded string of the SHA1 hash of the PublicKeyBlob field of the server
certificate received in TS_UD_SC_SEC1. The length, in bytes, of the PublicKeyBlob is given by the
wPublicKeyBlobLen field as specified in [MS-RDPBCGR] sections 2.2.1.4.3 and 2.2.1.4.3.1.1.

In addition to the KH attribute, the novice (server) SHOULD<5> generate the KH2 attribute of the
Auth String Node <A> in the Remote Assistance Connection String 2. If this parameter is present in
the connection string, the expert (client) validates the value of KH2 during the RDP connection. If this
parameter is absent in the connection string, the client uses the KH parameter for validating the
server as described in the previous paragraph. The KH2 value is a composite of the hashing algorithm
used and the base64 encoded string of the PublicKeyBlob field of the server certificate received in
TS_UD_SC_SEC1. The hashing algorithm can be sha256, sha384, or sha512. The hashing algorithm
and base64 encoded string of the hash are separated by a colon (:).

The Remote Assistance Connection String 2 starts with the root Node <E>. This root Node contains
the following child nodes:

3.  The Transport Node has Listener child Nodes that give information about the Server IP and port.

This Listener node <L> has the following attributes.

Value  Meaning

P

N

U

Port: The dynamic port on which the Remote Assistance connection could happen.

Server Name: The name/IP address of the server, that is, the novice computer.

URI: The full URI if websocket listener is enabled. The U (URI) is used instead of the P (port)
attribute. N (server name) attribute is still included.

The following is an example of Remote Assistance Connection String 2:

 <E>
     <A KH="YiKwWUY8Ioq5NB3wAQHSbs5kwrM="
KH2="sha256:wKSAkAV3sBfa9WpuRFJcP9q1twJc6wOBuoJ9tsyXwpk="
ID="8rYm30RBW8/4dAWoUsWbFCF5jno/7jr5t
 NpHQc2goLbw4uuBBJvLsU02YYLlBMg5"/>
     <C>
         <T ID="1" SID="1440550163">
             <L P="49749" N="2001:4898:1a:5:79e2:3356:9b22:3470"/>
             <L P="49751" N="172.31.250.64"/>
         </T>
     </C>
 </E>

In the preceding example:

1.  The Auth String Node <A> has the attribute KH="YiKwWUY8Ioq5NB3wAQHSbs5kwrM=",

KH2="sha256:wKSAkAV3sBfa9WpuRFJcP9q1twJc6wOBuoJ9tsyXwpk=", and attribute ID =
"8rYm30RBW8/4dAWoUsWbFCF5jno/7jr5tNpHQc2goLbw4uuBBJvLsU02YYLlBMg5".  In this
example, the KH2 value contains the encoded string
"wKSAkAV3sBfa9WpuRFJcP9q1twJc6wOBuoJ9tsyXwpk=" and the hashing algorithm used is
SHA256.

2.  The Connector Node <C> has one Transport child Node <T> with the following attributes:

ID = "1"

Session ID - SID = "1440550163"

3.  The Transport Node has two Listener child Nodes <L> with the following server and port

information attributes:

Port - P = "49749"

Server Name - N = "2001:4898:1a:5:79e2:3356:9b22:3470", and

Port - P = "49751"

Server Name - N = "172.31.250.64".

#### 2.2.3 SessionStateEnum

 typedef  enum
 {
   pchActive = 0,
   pchConnected = 1,
   pchConnectQuery = 2,
   pchShadow = 3,
   pchDisconnected = 4,
   pchIdle = 5,
   pchListen = 6,
   pchReset = 7,
   pchDown = 8,
   pchInit = 9,
   pchStateInvalid = 10
 } SessionStateEnum;

pchActive:  The user is logged on and active.

pchConnected:  The server is connected to the client.

pchConnectQuery:  The server is in the process of connecting to the client.

pchShadow:  The session is shadowing another session.

pchDisconnected:  The client has disconnected from the session.

pchIdle:  The session is waiting for a client to connect.

pchListen:  The session is listening for a request for a new connection. No user is logged on to a
listener session. A listener session cannot be reset, shadowed, or changed to a regular client
session.

pchReset:  The session is being reset.

pchDown:  The session is down due to an error.

pchInit:  The session is initializing.

### 3.2 IPCHService Remote Assistance Client Details

The following sections specify client details of the Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol, including
abstract data models, timers, and message processing rules.

#### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

The expert MUST specify the IP address or FQDN of the novice computer to use this protocol.

Using the specified IP address or FQDN of the novice computer, the expert connects to the novice
computer and invokes the RemoteUserSessionInfo method of IPCHService on the remote novice
computer and gets back a collection containing the DomainName, UserName, SessionID and
SessionState of the terminal services sessions from the novice computer.

The expert selects the terminal services session where Remote Assistance is to be offered and by
specifying the terminal services Session's DomainName, UserName and SessionID, invokes the
RemoteConnectionParms method of IPCHService on the remote novice computer to obtain the
Remote Assistance Connection String.

#### 3.2.2 Timers

No protocol timers are required other than those internal ones used in RPC to implement resiliency to
network outages, as specified in [MS-RPCE].

#### 3.2.3 Initialization

The client creates an RPC association (or binding) to the server RPC before an RPC method is called.
The client can either create a separate association for each method invocation, or it can reuse an
association for multiple invocations.

#### 3.2.4 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The following list shows the sequence of steps involved in a Remote Assistance Connection String
request:

1.  The client initiates the conversation with the server by performing DCOM activation, as specified in
[MS-DCOM] section 3.2.4.1.1, of the PCHService CLSID specified in section 1.9. As a result of
the activation, the client gets the PCHService's interface from the server.

2.  The client then obtains an additional IPCHService interface from the PCHService interface as

specified in [MS-DCOM] section 3.2.4.4.3.

3.  The client then invokes the RemoteUserSessionInfo method of the IPCHService interface to

retrieve an ISAFSession interface pointers' collection of type IPCHCollection.

4.  Enumerate the ISAFSession interfaces of the server by repeatedly calling the Item method of the
IPCHCollection interface. The collected list of session information is presented to the Remote
Assistance user, by means of an implementation-specific user interface, to decide which session
to connect to.

5.  From the collected ISAFSession interface values, a session is chosen by the Remote Assistance

user. The SessionID and corresponding DomainName and UserName are passed in a call to the
RemoteConnectionParms method of the IPCHService interface. This call returns the Remote
Assistance Connection String for the specified session. Sessions with no DomainName or
UserName MUST be ignored.

6.  This Remote Assistance Connection String is valid to begin the Remote Assistance connection.

#### 3.2.5 Timer Events

No protocol timer events are required on the client other than the events maintained in the underlying
RPC transport.

#### 3.2.6 Other Local Events

No additional local events are used on the client other than the events maintained in the underlying
RPC transport.

### 3.3 IRASrv Remote Assistance Server Details

The Remote Assistance Server provides methods to allow a client to:

  Get the collection of the terminal services sessions on the remote novice computer.

  Get a Remote Assistance Connection String for a specified user session on the remote novice

computer.

The following sections specify server details of the Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol, including
abstract data models, timers, and initialization.

## 6 Appendix A: Remote Assistance Invitation File Format

The purpose of the Remote Assistance Initiation Protocol is to obtain the Remote Assistance
Connection String using DCOM. However, the implementer is free to use alternative approaches to
obtain the connection string. One such alternative approach implemented in Windows is to transmit
the Remote Assistance Invitation File over email as an XML file.<15>

The expert computer parses the Remote Assistance Invitation File to extract the Remote Assistance
Connection String and other information.

There are two version-specific types of the Remote Assistance Invitation File.

The following is a sample Remote Assistance Invitation File of the first type:<16>

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="Unicode" ?>
     <UPLOADINFO TYPE="Escalated">

UPLOADINFO

The UPLOADINFO TYPE is set to "Escalated".

UPLOADDATA  The UPLOADDATA contains the following information:

USERNAME: The name of the Remote Assistance novice computer.

RCTICKET: The Remote Assistance Connection String.

RCTICKETENCRYPTED: Indicates whether the ticket identified by RCTICKET is encrypted.
RCTICKETENCRYPTED = 1 means the ticket is encrypted, zero means the ticket is not encrypted.

DtStart: The time when the Remote Assistance Connection String was created. This time is the
number of seconds elapsed since UTC 1/1/70.

DtLength: The duration for which the Remote Assistance Connection String is valid. This is
expressed in minutes. If the expert computer cannot connect to the novice computer successfully
within this time, Remote Assistance closes on the novice computer.

PassStub: The encrypted novice computer's password string. When the Remote Assistance
Connection String is sent as a file over email, to provide additional security, a password is
used.<17>

L: Indicates whether the novice computer is connected via a modem. L = 1 means MODEM is
used, 0 means high-speed connectivity is used.

DtLength: The duration for which the Remote Assistance Connection String is valid. This is
expressed in minutes. If the expert computer cannot connect to the novice computer successfully
within this time, Remote Assistance closes on the novice computer.

PassStub: The encrypted novice computer password string. When the Remote Assistance
Connection String is sent as a file over email, to provide additional security, a password is used.

L: Indicates whether the novice computer is connected via a modem. L = 1 means MODEM is
used, 0 means high-speed connectivity is used.

The following diagram shows the password encryption flow for specific implementations.<22>

  Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 do not implement IRASrv. A novice running one of these

versions of Windows cannot be initiated through IRASrv.

  Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 implement IPCHService. A Windows XP or Windows Server

2003 novice can be initiated only through IPCHService.

  A Windows Vista and later and Windows Server 2008 and later expert first attempts to call IRASrv,

and if that fails, the expert then attempts to call the IPCHService interface.

  A Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 expert will only attempt to call IPCHService and will not be
able to connect to a novice running Windows Vista and later or Windows Server 2008 and later.

<3> Section 2.2.1: This form of the Remote Assistance Connection String is obtained from Remote
Assistance running on a Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 novice.

XP and Windows Server 2003.

<5> Section 2.2.2:  The KH2 attribute is not implemented in Windows XP or later.

<6> Section 3.1.4.1: This interface and its called interfaces, IPCHCollection and ISAFSession, are only
called by Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

<7> Section 3.1.4.1:  Opnums 3 and 4 are used used locally by Windows, never remotely.

<8> Section 3.1.4.1.1: Access denied error is returned only for Windows XP operating system Service
Pack 1 (SP1) and the initial release of Windows Server 2003.

<9> Section 3.1.4.1.2: Access denied error is returned only for Windows XP SP1 and the initial release
of Windows Server 2003.

<15> Section 6: In Windows, the XML file has the extension MSRCIncident.

<16> Section 6: This version is specific to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

<17> Section 6: A password can be used in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. For security
reasons it is advisable to protect the Remote Assistance invitation file using a password.

In Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, when a password is used, it is encrypted using
PROV_RSA_FULL predefined Cryptographic provider with MD5 hashing and CALG_RC4, the RC4 stream
encryption algorithm. More details are in the Cryptography Reference [MSDN-CRYPTO].

The password is translated into a Unicode string before it is hashed. The passStub is a 14 character
Unicode string. Also, the passStub is prefixed with a four-byte integer that contains the number of
bytes in the following data string, as defined in BSTR data type ([MS-DTYP] section 2.2.5), when
performing the encryption.

<18> Section 6: This diagram applies to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 implementations

Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, the password is mandatory and it is encrypted using the
MS_ENH_RSA_AES_PROV predefined Cryptographic provider with CALG_SHA hashing and the
CALG_AES_128 encryption algorithm. The cipher mode used can be CRYPT_MODE_CBC and the
password used during the encryption process is a Unicode string.

<21> Section 6: This attribute can be present for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003
compatibility.

<22> Section 6: This diagram applies to the following Windows implementations: Windows Vista,
Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012.

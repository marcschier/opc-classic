## 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding to the Group Policy: Core
Protocol, as specified in [MS-GPOL], and provides a mechanism for an administrator to control any
behavior on a client that depends on registry-based settings.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

### 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

Active Directory: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses

LDAP as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of
objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related
credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE]. Active Directory is either deployed as Active
Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS),
which are both described in [MS-ADOD]: Active Directory Protocols Overview.

administrative template: A file associated with a Group Policy Object (GPO) that combines

information on the syntax of registry-based policy settings with human-readable descriptions of
the settings, as well as other information.

client-side extension GUID (CSE GUID): A GUID  that enables a specific client-side extension
on the Group Policy client to be associated with policy data that is stored in the logical and
physical components of a Group Policy Object (GPO) on the Group Policy server, for that
particular extension.

computer-scoped Group Policy Object path: A scoped Group Policy Object (GPO) path that

ends in "\Machine".

curly braced GUID string: The string representation of a 128-bit globally unique identifier

(GUID) using the form {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}, where X denotes a
hexadecimal digit. The string representation between the enclosing braces is the standard
representation of a GUID as described in [RFC4122] section 3. Unlike a GUIDString, a curly
braced GUID string includes enclosing braces.

domain: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management

infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller (DC)
and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally hosting
the Active Directory service. The domain controller provides authentication of members,
creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared among its
members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS].

Extended Administrative Template (ADMX): A pair of files that combines information on the
syntax of registry-based policy settings with human-readable descriptions of the settings, as
well as other information. The first file contains the language-neutral description of each setting,
while the second file contains the language-specific information.

globally unique identifier (GUID): A term used interchangeably with universally unique

identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of
these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value.
Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in
[RFC4122] or [C706] have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique
identifier (UUID).

Group Policy Object (GPO): A collection of administrator-defined specifications of the policy
settings that can be applied to groups of computers in a domain. Each GPO includes two
elements: an object that resides in the Active Directory for the domain, and a corresponding
file system subdirectory that resides on the sysvol DFS share of the Group Policy server for the
domain.

Group Policy Object (GPO) path: A domain-based Distributed File System (DFS) path for a

directory on the server that is accessible through the DFS/SMB protocols. This path will always
be a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path of the form: "\\<dns domain name>\sysvol\<dns
domain name>\policies\<gpo guid>", where <dns domain name> is the DNS domain name of
the domain and <gpo guid> is a Group Policy Object (GPO) GUID.

Network Access Protection (NAP): A feature of an operating system that provides a platform
for system health-validated access to private networks. NAP provides a way of detecting the
health state of a network client that is attempting to connect to or communicate on a network,
and limiting the access of the network client until the health policy requirements have been met.
NAP is implemented through quarantines and health checks, as specified in [TNC-IF-
TNCCSPBSoH].

policy setting: A statement of the possible behaviors of an element of a domain member

computer's behavior that can be configured by an administrator.

registry: A local system-defined database in which applications and system components store and
retrieve configuration data. It is a hierarchical data store with lightly typed elements that are
logically stored in tree format. Applications use the registry API to retrieve, modify, or delete
registry data. The data stored in the registry varies according to the version of the operating
system.

registry policy file: A file associated with a Group Policy Object (GPO) that contains a set of

registry-based policy settings.

scoped Group Policy Object (GPO) path: A Group Policy Object (GPO) path appended with
"\User" for the user policy mode of policy application, and "\Machine" for the computer policy
mode.

tool extension GUID or administrative plug-in GUID: A GUID defined separately for each of
the user policy settings and computer policy settings that associates a specific administrative
tool plug-in with a set of policy settings that can be stored in a Group Policy Object (GPO).

user-scoped Group Policy Object path: A scoped Group Policy Object (GPO) path that ends

in "\User".

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the
most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents
in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not
match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the Errata.

### 1.3 Overview

Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding provides a mechanism for an administrator to control any
behavior on a client that depends on registry-based settings.

#### 1.3.1 Background

The Group Policy: Core Protocol (as specified in [MS-GPOL]) allows clients to discover and retrieve
policy settings created by administrators of a domain. These settings are persisted within Group
Policy Objects (GPOs) that are assigned to Policy Target accounts in the Active Directory. Policy
Target accounts are either computer accounts or user accounts in the Active Directory. Each client
uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to determine what GPOs are applicable to it by
consulting the Active Directory objects corresponding to both its computer account and the user
accounts of any users logging on to the client computer.

On each client, each GPO is interpreted and acted upon by software components known as client plug-
ins. The client plug-ins responsible for a given GPO are specified using an attribute on the GPO. This
attribute specifies a list of globally unique identifier (GUID) lists. The first GUID of each GUID list
is referred to as a client-side extension GUID (CSE GUID). Other GUIDs in the GUID list are
referred to as tool extension GUIDs.

For each GPO that is applicable to a client, the client consults the CSE GUIDs listed in the GPO to
determine which client plug-in handles the GPO. The client then invokes the client plug-in to handle
the GPO.

A client plug-in uses the contents of the GPO to retrieve settings specific to its class in a manner
specific to its class. After its class-specific settings are retrieved, the client plug-in uses those settings
to perform class-specific processing.

#### 1.3.2 Registry Extension Encoding Overview

Registry-based settings are accessible from a GPO through the Group Policy: Registry Extension
Encoding. The protocol provides mechanisms both for administrative tools (or any tool that allows an
administrator to view or modify the contents of a GPO) to obtain metadata about registry-based
settings and for clients to obtain applicable registry-based settings.

templates (as specified in Policy Description Message (section 2.2.2)). An administrative template is
a file associated with a GPO that combines information on the syntax of registry-based settings with
human-readable descriptions of the settings as well as other information. Administrative tools use
administrative templates to allow administrators to configure registry-based settings for applications
on clients.

Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding settings are specified using registry policy files (as
specified in Registry Policy Message Syntax (section 2.2.1)). An administrative tool uses the
information within the administrative template to write out a registry policy file and associate it with a
GPO. The Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding plug-in on each client reads registry policy files
specified by applicable GPOs and applies their contents to its registry.

Only a limited subset of the syntax for registry policy files is supported by administrative templates.
As a result, not all registry-based settings can be expressed using administrative templates. Such
registry-based settings can be implemented using a custom user-interface that does not rely on
administrative templates.

The protocol operates as follows. An administrative tool either implements a custom UI that can
author registry policy files or just uses administrative templates, or both administrative templates can
be stored on a server and be retrieved (using this protocol) by an administrative tool. Or, the tool can
simply use administrative templates that are already on the administrator's computer.

Clients can use either or both of the following cases for this protocol because they address different
issues. The Computer Policy Mode is used in scenarios where the policies need to be applied to a
computer, and it is applicable for all the users logging on to the computer, whereas the User Policy
Mode is used for applying policies to specific users logging on to the computer.

Computer Policy Mode

1.  An administrator invokes a Group Policy Administrative tool on the administrator's computer to

administer a GPO through the Group Policy Core Protocol using the Policy Administration mode, as
specified in [MS-GPOL] section 1.3.2. The Administrative tool invokes a plug-in specific to Group
Policy: Registry Extension Encoding so that the administrator can administer the Group Policy:
Registry Extension Encoding settings. This results in the storage and retrieval of metadata inside a
GPO on a Group Policy server. This metadata describes configuration settings to be applied to a
generic settings database (or registry) on a client that is affected by the GPO. The administrator
views the data and updates it to add a directive to run a command when the client computer
starts up. If they are not already present from a prior update, the CSE GUID and tool extension
GUID for Computer Policy Settings for Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding are written to
the GPO.

2.  A client computer affected by that GPO is started (or is connected to the network, if this happens
after the client starts), and the Group Policy Core Protocol is invoked by the client to retrieve
Policy Settings from the Group Policy server. As part of the processing of the Group Policy Core
Protocol, the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding's CSE GUID is read from this GPO, and
this instructs the client to invoke a Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding plug-in component
for Policy Application.

3.  In processing the Policy Application portion of the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding, the
client parses the file of settings, and then saves the settings in the generic settings database (or
registry) on the local computer.

User Policy Mode

1.  This step is the same as step 1 for Computer Policy Mode except that a separate tool extension

GUID for the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding is written to the GPO.

2.  This step is the same as step 2 for Computer Policy Mode except that it occurs when a user logs

on (or when the computer is connected to the network, if this happens after the user logs on).

3.  In processing the Policy Application portion of Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding, the

client parses the file of settings, and then saves the settings in a user-specific portion of the
generic settings database (registry) on the local computer.

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol depends on the Group Policy: Core Protocol (as specified in [MS-GPOL]) to provide a list
of applicable Group Policy Objects (GPOs). It also transmits Group Policy settings and instructions
between the client and the Group Policy server by reading and writing files using remote file access.
See [MS-WPO] section 6.4 for an overview of remote file access.

This protocol is used instead of the Windows Remote Registry Protocol, specified in [MS-RRP], to
configure the same settings on many computers.

The following diagram shows how this protocol relates to other protocols.

Figure 1: Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding protocol relationship diagram

### 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The prerequisites for this protocol are the same as those for the Group Policy: Core Protocol.

In addition, a client needs a system/subsystem that is capable of executing commands at start-
up/shutdown time (if Computer Policy Mode is used) and at user log-on/log-off time (if User Policy
Mode is used).

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding is only applicable within the Group Policy: Core Protocol
framework. Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding is used to express the required state of the
client. However, it is not used to express intentions that are sensitive in an information disclosure
context because the metadata transmitted by the protocol is not encrypted. For example, an
administrator is not to use this protocol to transmit a password needed by the client to access a
resource, because that password is unencrypted during transmission and can be easily intercepted by
an unauthorized user, thus compromising the resource.

This protocol is also only applicable when the requirement is for many clients to get the same settings.
To configure individual clients with custom settings, the Windows Remote Registry Protocol can be
used instead. For more information, see [MS-RRP].

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

There is no capability negotiation based on versioning in this protocol. There are several fields that
provide version information. The Registry Policy Message Syntax (section 2.2.1) contains a version
which is a fixed value. An ADM-Based Policy Description Message can contain an ADM Conditional
Directive described in section 2.2.2.1.1 that compares the current platform against a version constant
that represents platform releases. The ADMX-Based Policy Description Message schema described in
Appendix B: Full XML Schemas (section 7) contains informational revision and schemaVersion
attributes.

### 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

None.

### 1.9 Standards Assignments

This protocol defines client-side extension GUID (CSE GUID) and tool extension GUID standards
assignments, as specified in [MS-GPOL] section 1.8. The assignments are as follows. Where two
possible GUIDs are listed, the value used is implementation dependent.<1><2>

### 2.1 Transport

The Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding uses remote file access. All messages are exchanged
as files transferred using remote file access.

The Group Policy: Core Protocol uses this protocol CSE GUID (as specified in [MS-DTYP] section
2.3.4.3) and tool extension GUID values to invoke this protocol only to access GPOs that require
processing by this protocol.

### 2.2 Message Syntax

The sections that follow specify the syntax for the following protocol elements:

Registry policy files (as specified in Registry Policy Message Syntax (section 2.2.1)).

The administrative templates (ADM format) file (as specified in ADM-Based Policy Description
Message (section 2.2.2.1)) and the Extended Administrative Templates (ADMX) file (as specified
in ADMX-Based Policy Description Message (section 2.2.2.2)).

Each protocol element is described as a message, which corresponds one-to-one with a file transferred
using remote file access. The protocol is driven through the exchange of these messages, as specified
in Protocol Details (section 3).

#### 2.2.1 Registry Policy Message Syntax

The following definitions will aid in understanding this section:

  Computer-scoped GPO path:

A scoped GPO path that ends in "\Machine".

  Scoped GPO path:

A GPO path that is appended with "\User" for User Policy Mode of Policy Application or
"\Machine" for Computer Policy Mode.

  User-scoped Group Policy Object path:

A scoped GPO path that ends in "\User".

This protocol uses remote file access to copy the file that MUST be named "<gpo
path>\registry.pol", where <gpo path> is a scoped GPO path given to the protocol by the Group
Policy: Core Protocol, as specified in [MS-GPOL] section 2.2.8. The message is the file itself.

The contents of the Registry.pol file read above MUST be formatted according to the following
Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) (as specified in the [RFC4234]) description).

PolicyFile = Header Body
Header = Signature Version
Signature = %x50.52.65.67
Version = %x01
Body = Instructions
Instructions = Instruction / (Instructions Instruction)
IdCharacter = %x20-5B / %x5D-7E
ValueCharacter = SP / VCHAR
Key = 1*IdCharacter
Instruction = "[" KeyPath ";" Value ";" Type ";" Size ";" Data "]"

KeyPath = Key / KeyPath "\" Key
Value = 1*259ValueCharacter
Type = %x01 / %x02 / %x03 / %x04 / %x05 / %x07 / %x0B
Size = %x00-FFFF
Data = *65535OCTET

The meanings and encoding format of the fields are as follows:

  Key:

A null-terminated identifier of a record used to distinguish the record and efficiently search for
it. The same Key can appear multiple times in the message. HKLM and HKCU MUST NOT be
included in the identifier. If registry.pol file is under the computer-scoped path, the root of the
key MUST be HKLM; if the file is under the user-scoped path, the root of the key MUST be
HKCU. The encoding format is UTF-16LE.

  Value:

The null-terminated name of the column in a conceptual database record. The encoding format
is UTF-16LE.



Type:

MUST be one of the following:

 Value

0x01

REG_SZ

0x02

REG_EXPAND_SZ

0x03

REG_BINARY

0x04

REG_DWORD

0x05

REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN

0x07

REG_MULTI_SZ

0x0B

REG_QWORD

 Meaning

Data in the Data field to be interpreted as a null-terminated Unicode string.

Data in the Data field to be interpreted as a null-terminated Unicode string
that contains operating system environment variables denoted using an
operating system-specific syntax.

Data in the Data field to be interpreted as an octet stream.

Data to be interpreted in the same fashion as a 32-bit number in little-
endian format.

Data to be interpreted in the same fashion as a 32-bit number in big-
endian format.

Data in the Data field to be interpreted as a sequence of characters
terminated by two null Unicode characters, and within that sequence zero
or more null-terminated Unicode strings can exist.

Data in the Data field to be interpreted as a 64-bit number in little-endian
format.

The field is represented as 32-bit little-endian.

  Size:

Indicates the size, in bytes, of the Data field. MUST be in the range 0 to 65535, represented as
32-bit little-endian.

  Data:

[MS-GPREG] - v20240423

Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

13 / 81


Indicates the data associated with the value. This field MUST contain a number of bytes data
indicated by the value of the Size field.

  Signature:

A 32-bit identifier for all registry.pol files.

  Version:

A 32-bit little-endian number.

The order of the Instruction elements is significant: two such messages that differ only in the order of
the Instruction elements are not considered equivalent messages semantically. This is because
message processing is sensitive to the order, as specified in Client Plug-In Details (section 3.2).<3>

#### 2.2.2 Policy Description Message

Policy Description Messages are typically used by administrative plug-in to drive a user interface for
viewing and editing settings, and are most importantly used to describe the serialization and
deserialization of settings to and from the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding Message format.
There are two formats for these messages: ADM and ADMX.

##### 2.2.2.1 ADM-Based Policy Description Message

ADM-Based Policy Description Messages are encapsulated in Unicode files that are transmitted using
remote file access. The names of these files MUST end in ".adm".

The following ABNF specifies the ADM file format.

CheckBox

Policy Administration plug-ins are expected to present a control that allows the user to select a
single check box.

EditText

Policy Administration plug-ins are expected to present a simple string control for viewing and
editing this setting.

ComboBox

Policy Administration plug-ins are expected to present a simple list control that also allows
manual editing for viewing and editing this setting.

 Value

 Meaning

DropDownList  Policy Administration plug-ins are expected to present a control that allows the user to select a

single item from a drop-down list.

Numeric

ListBox

Policy Administration plug-ins are expected to present a simple numeric control for viewing and
editing this setting.

Policy Administration plug-ins are expected to present a list user interface control for viewing and
editing this setting. If not modified with "additive", this MUST be serialized to the format
specified in Registry Policy Message Syntax (section 2.2.1) with an instruction that is preceded
by an instruction using the "***DeleteKeys" value (the quoted value string MUST be taken
literally), as specified in Client Plug-In Details (section 3.2).

Text

Policy Administration plug-ins are expected to just display the characters, following this literally.
There is no user input to serialize or deserialize.

The following nonterminal symbols imply important semantics for presentation or serialization:

  AdmOemConvert:

If present, indicates that the string value associated with this part MUST be converted to ASCII
before serialization. ASCII refers to a single 8-bit ASCII character or an array of 8-bit ASCII
characters with the high bit of each character set to zero.

  AdmExpandableText:

If present, indicates that, for this associated part, the Registry Policy Message Data Type from
Registry Policy Message Syntax (section 2.2.1) MUST be serialized using type 0x02 from
Registry Policy Message Syntax (section 2.2.1).

  AdmAdditive:

If present, indicates that for AdmListBox controls, the Policy Setting MUST be serialized into
Registry Policy format without being preceded by an instruction to delete all values (see section
Registry Policy Message Sequencing (section 3.2.5.1)).

  AdmExplicitValue:

If present, indicates that for AdmListBox controls, both the Value and Data to serialize to, from
the Registry Policy Message specification (as specified in Registry Policy Message
Syntax (section 2.2.1)), MUST come from an administrative tool's user input. If AdmValuePrefix
is also specified, it is ignored.

  AdmValuePrefix <prefix>:

Specifies that any registry values associated with this part MUST be prepended with <prefix>
when serialized to the Registry Policy message format.

  AdmSpin <spinvalue>:

 Specifies that the Policy Administration plug-ins are expected to present the associated part in
the user interface using a type of control that allows the user to increment or decrement integer
values through the control. A <spinvalue> of 0 removes the spin control. A <spinvalue> of 1 is
the default.



 AdmTextConvert:

 If present, indicates that the Policy Administration plug-ins MUST serialize the associated value
into the Registry Policy format using type 0x01 (string), as specified in Registry Policy Message
Syntax (section 2.2.1), even if the value is numeric.

Release: April 23, 2024


  AdmDefChecked:

 If present, indicates that the administrative plug-in MUST enable their associated AdmCheckBox
control when a user initially attempts to enable the associated setting.

  AdmMax <maxvalue>:

 Specifies that the administrative plug-in that consume this format to edit a GPO MUST enforce
a maximum value for the number. This value is a 32-bit integer and can be set to a maximum of
2^32 - 1. If this value is not specified, then the default value is 9999.

  AdmMin <minvalue>:

Specifies that the administrative plug-in that consumes this format to edit a GPO MUST enforce
a minimum value for the number. This value is a 32-bit integer and can be set to a maximum of
2^32 - 1. If this value is not specified, then the default value is 0.

  AdmSupported <descriptive string>:

Specifies that the administrative plug-in MUST display a descriptive string describing any other
requirements for the associated part to be supported.

  AdmClientExt <extension GUID>:

Specifies that for each AdmClient <extension GUID> occurrence, the administrative plug-in
MUST send a GPO Extension Update Message (as specified in [MS-GPOL] section 2.2.8.2) to
increment the GPO version and add the <Tool Extension GUID> (as defined in section 1.9) and
<extension GUID> to either of the following attributes:

The gPCUserExtensionNames attribute if the GPO's user settings are being updated.

The gPCMachineExtensionNames attribute if the computer settings are being updated.

These attributes are updated on the current GPO. They provide for the application of policy to
the client by the Registry Extension.

These attributes also provide for additional processing by a second client extension. The second
client extension has the opportunity to process the entire GPO.

  AdmMaxLen <maxlength>:

Specifies that the Policy Administration plug-in MUST limit the text in the associated part to be,
at most, <maxlength> characters.

  AdmNoSort:

If present, indicates that the administrative plug-in MUST NOT sort the entries when displaying
the associated AdmCombobox, AdmDropdownlist, or AdmListbox.

  AdmRequired:

 Specifies that the administrative plug-in that consume this format MUST NOT allow updates of
the GPO for the registry key unless a value has been provided in the user interface.

###### 2.2.2.1.1 ADM Conditional Directive

In addition to the ABNF syntax specified, the ADM file allows a conditional directive to include or
exclude portions of the file depending on the version of the ADM file.

The following specifies the syntax of the conditional directive.

 AdmOperator = (TokGT / TokLT / TokEQ / TokNE / TokGE / TokLE)
 TokDigits =         WhiteSpace 1*DIGIT               SpaceDelimiter
 TokEQ =             WhiteSpace "=="                  SpaceDelimiter
 TokEndif =          WhiteSpace "#endif"              SpaceDelimiter
 TokGE =             WhiteSpace ">="                  SpaceDelimiter
 TokGT =             WhiteSpace ">"                   SpaceDelimiter
 TokIf =             WhiteSpace "#if"                 SpaceDelimiter
 TokLE =             WhiteSpace "<="                  SpaceDelimiter
 TokLT =             WhiteSpace "<"                   SpaceDelimiter
 TokNE =             WhiteSpace "!="                  SpaceDelimiter
 TokVersion =        WhiteSpace "version"             SpaceDelimiter

The ADM Conditional Directive is broad enough that it is best understood as a "pre-processing"
directive. The enclosed text is either included or excluded from parsing depending on the condition
specified. Conditional directives can appear anywhere in the ADM file and they can be nested.

The TokDigits are interpreted as a version number corresponding to the operating system version at
the time the ADM was released.<4>

##### 2.2.2.2 ADMX-Based Policy Description Message

ADMX-Based Policy Description Messages are encapsulated in XML (as specified in [XML1.0]) files that
are copied using remote file access. To support the multilingual display of policy settings, the ADMX-
Based Policy Description Messages are divided into two types of files, described in the following
sections. The format of these files is specified by the XML schemas in Appendix B: Full XML
Schemas (section 7).<5>

###### 2.2.2.2.1 ADMX File

An .admx file is a language-neutral file describing the structure of the categories and administrative
template policy settings. The two primary components of an .admx file are the <categories> and
<policies> elements which contain individual <category> or <policy> element definitions respectively.

###### 2.2.2.2.1.1 categories Element

Within <categories>, a <category> element defines an empty set to which policies MAY be assigned.
Categories are exclusively used during the presentation of policies by administrative plug-ins. The
displayName attribute of a <category> MAY be a reference to a language-specific string read from a
language-specific .adml file. The format for a stringReference and examples are described below.

###### 2.2.2.2.1.2 policies Element

Within <policies>, a <policy> element MUST be assigned to one and only one <category> using a
<parentCategory> subelement. String attributes of a <policy> MAY be a reference to a language-
specific string read from a language-specific .adml file. A <policy> MAY also contain a language-
specific presentation attribute which is a presentationReference read from a language-specific .adml
file. The format for a presentationReference and examples are described below.

If a stringReference or presentationReference is used in an .admx file, it MUST be found in the .adml
file currently in use or an error condition MUST be signaled.

###### 2.2.2.2.1.3 stringReference

A stringReference MUST be in the format "$(string.<id>)" where the "id" MUST be found in the
language-specific .adml file <stringTable>.

Release: April 23, 2024


###### 2.2.2.2.1.4 presentationReference

A presentationReference MUST be in the format "$(presentation.<id>)" where the "id" MUST be found
in the language-specific .adml file <presentationTable>.

###### 2.2.2.2.2 ADML File

An .adml file is a set of language-dependent resources providing the localized portions (strings and
presentations) of an .admx file. Each .adml file will represent a single language that needs to be
supported. The name of these files MUST be the same as the .admx file name ending with an .adml
instead of an .admx. An .adml file for each language is stored in a directory matching the language
locale name under the directory where the .admx files are stored. There is no explicit reference to the
.adml file in the .admx file. The association is based on the language and the .admx file name replaced
with .adml in the end. For each .admx file, there will be as many .adml files as the number of
languages supported.

The primary component of an .adml file is the <resources> element.

###### 2.2.2.2.2.1 resources Element



Within the <resources> element, the <stringTable> and <presentationTable> elements contain the
language-specific elements supporting stringReference and presentationReference functionality.

###### 2.2.2.2.2.1.1 stringTable Element

The <stringTable> element will contain <string> elements defining the language-specific strings that
MAY be referenced by "id" from the language-neutral .admx file.

###### 2.2.2.2.2.1.2 presentationTable Element

The <presentationTable> element will contain <presentation> elements that MAY be referenced by
"id" from the language-neutral .admx file defining the user interface components presented by
administrative plug-ins.

###### 2.2.2.2.3 ADMX/ADML File Reference Examples

The Base ADMX Schema (section 7.1) contains the definitions for the simpleTypes stringReference and
presentationReference used in the language-neutral .admx file to indicate a localized item that MUST
be referenced in the language-dependent .adml files. For example, in the sample .admx file in section
4.4.1, the policy with the name "Sample_Checkbox" (excerpt shown below) contains two attributes
with an id defined in the language-specific .adml file; displayName and explainText indicated by the
presence of the "$(string.<id>)" attribute value. It also contains a presentation attribute with an id
defined in the language-specific .adml file indicated by the presence of the "$(presentation.<id>)"
attribute value. In the sample .adml file in section 4.4.2, shown below, the string resources
"Sample_Checkbox" and "Sample_Checkbox_Help" are defined in the <stringTable> element and the
presentation "Sample_Checkbox" is defined in the <presentationTable> element.

.admx file (excerpt from the policies element)

 <policy name="Sample_Checkbox" class="Both" displayName="$(string.Sample_Checkbox)"
 explainText="$(string.Sample_Checkbox_Help)" presentation="$(presentation.Sample_Checkbox)"
 key="Software\Policies\Examples">

.adml file (excerpt from the stringTable)

 <string id="Sample_Checkbox">Sets policy setting parameter via a check box</string>

 <string id="Sample_Checkbox_Help">This is an example of a Group Policy setting that
configures a parameter using a check box.

 If you enable this policy setting, check box1 and check box2 will be active.
 Note: Check box2 will be checked by default.

 If you disable this policy setting, no check box will be active.

 If you do not configure this policy setting, the value will be deleted, if currently set to a
value.

 Note: This policy setting changes the Example2Checkbox1 and Example2Checkbox2 registry
values.</string>

.adml file (excerpt from the presentationTable)

 <presentation id="Sample_Checkbox">
   <checkBox refId="Checkbox_1">First check box parameter</checkBox>
   <checkBox refId="Checkbox_2" defaultChecked="true">Second check box parameter - checked by
default</checkBox>
 </presentation>

##### 2.2.2.3 ADM-based policies compared to ADMX-based policies

There is no difference in the registry.pol file format based on the use of ADM-based policies or ADMX-
based policies, so the serialization/deserialization of policy settings is identical. ADMX-based policies
MAY set the full value of a REG_QWORD by using the presentation element LongDecimalElement and
MAY set a REG_MULTI_SZ value using the presentation element multiTextElement. Both are defined in
Appendix B: Full XML Schemas (section 7).

#### 2.2.3 Policy Comment Message

The Policy Comment Messages are typically used by administrative plug-ins to drive a user interface
for viewing and editing comments associated with Extended Administrative Templates settings.
The file format for these messages is encapsulated in XML (as specified in [XML1.0]) files that are
accessed via remote file access.

CMTX-Based Policy Comment Messages are encapsulated in XML (as specified in [XML1.0]) files that
are copied via remote file access. The names of these files MUST end in either .cmtx or .cmtl. The
format of these files is specified by the XML schemas in Appendix B (sections 7.4 and 7.5).<6>

A .cmtx file created or updated by an Administrative plug-in will always contain embedded string
resources. A .cmtx file MAY be localized manually by following Policy Administration Comment
Localization Message Sequencing (section 3.1.5.7), in which case the .cmtx file will not contain
embedded string resources. The string resources will be located in the language-specific .cmtl files.

### 2.3 Directory Service Schema Elements

None.

## 3 Protocol Details

### 3.1 Administrative Plug-in Details

#### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

The administrative abstract data model mirrors the client abstract data model in Abstract Data
Model (section 3.2.1), the difference being that the administrative abstract data model is logically
encapsulated within a single GPO's User Policy and Computer Policy sections.

This protocol also includes one ADM element, Administered GPO (Public), which is directly accessed
from the Group Policy: Core Protocol, as specified in [MS-GPOL] section 3.3.1.3.

##### 3.1.1.1 Group Policy Object (GPO)

The GPO contains a Policy Description Store, Policy Comment State, User Policy Setting State,
and Computer Policy Setting State.

##### 3.1.1.2 Policy Description Store

The Policy Description Store has the following structure:

  Policy Description Store for ADMX files: The Policy Description Store for ADMX files is a file

system directory given by the location "\\<dns domain name>\sysvol\<dns domain
name>\Policies\policydefinitions\" on the Group Policy server. Underneath this directory is a set of
files with names that end in .admx. These are files that MUST be in the ADMX-Based Policy
Description Message format.



Policy Description Storage for ADM files: The Policy Description Store for ADM files is a file
system directory given by the location "<gpo path>\adm" on the Group Policy server. Underneath
this directory is a set of files with names that end in .adm. These are files that MUST be in the
ADM-Based Policy Description Message format.

This state describes a subset of the settings modeled in the User Policy Setting State and the
Computer Policy Setting State of this GPO.

##### 3.1.1.3 Computer Policy Setting State

The Computer Policy Setting State has the same structure as that specified for the client in Policy
Setting State (section 3.2.1.1), except that settings are persisted in a file as defined in Registry Policy
Message Syntax (section 2.2.1). This file is loaded as a collection of named-value pairs for
Administrative Plug-ins that extend the Registry Extension.

##### 3.1.1.4 User Policy Setting State

The User Policy Setting State has the same structure as that specified for the client in Policy Setting
State (section 3.2.1.1), except that settings are persisted in a file as defined in Registry Policy
Message Syntax (section 2.2.1). This file is loaded as a collection of named-value pairs for
Administrative Plug-ins that extend the Registry Extension.

##### 3.1.1.5 Policy Comment State

The Policy Comment State comprises a CMTX file and optional CMTL files as described in Policy
Comment Message (section 2.2.3).

#### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

#### 3.1.3 Initialization

At initialization, the Group Policy: Core Protocol (as specified in [MS-GPOL]) provides a Group Policy
Object (GPO) path corresponding to the Group Policy Object (GPO) applicable to this protocol.

#### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

Higher-layer triggered events occur in the following situations:

  An administrator makes a change to any Registry Policy Setting. The sequence of events would

include, if the Registry Administrative Plug-in was used to make the change, the ADM-Based Policy
Description Load Event defined in section 3.1.4.5 and/or the ADMX-Based Policy Description Load
Event defined in section 3.1.4.6, and the Load Policy Settings Event defined in section 3.1.4.1,
and, after updates were made, the Update Policy Settings Event defined in section 3.1.4.2.



The Registry Policy Setting is viewed. The sequence would include, if the Registry Administrative
Plug-in was used to view the setting, the ADM-Based Policy Description Load Event defined in
section 3.1.4.5 and/or the ADMX-Based Policy Description Load Event defined in section 3.1.4.6,
the Load Policy Settings Event defined in section 3.1.4.1.

  An administrator makes a change to any Registry Policy Comments. The sequence of events would
include the Load Policy Comments Event defined in section 3.1.4.3, and after updates were made,
the Update Policy Comments Event defined in section 3.1.4.4.



The Registry Policy Comments are viewed. The sequence would include the Load Policy Comments
Event defined in section 3.1.4.3.

##### 3.1.4.1 Load Policy Settings Event

The Load Policy Settings event can be invoked by Group Policy Extensions to read their registry-based
policy.

<gpo path>: Identifies the GPO containing the settings.

Policy Setting State: The value of the settings in the GPO as described in Computer Policy Setting

State (section 3.1.1.3) and User Policy Setting State (section 3.1.1.4).

This event causes the Policy Administration Load Message Sequence (section 3.1.5.3) to be performed
using the <gpo path> and Policy Setting State logical parameters from this event.

##### 3.1.4.2 Update Policy Settings Event

The Update Policy Settings event can be invoked by Group Policy Extensions to update their registry-
based policy settings. The logical parameters are:

<gpo path>: Identifies the GPO in which to store the settings.

Policy Setting State: The value of the settings to be stored as described in Computer Policy

Setting State (section 3.1.1.3) and User Policy Setting State (section 3.1.1.4).

This event causes the Policy Administration Update Message Sequence (section 3.1.5.4) to be
performed using the <gpo path> and Policy Setting State logical parameters from this event.

23 / 81


##### 3.1.4.3 Load Policy Comments Event

The Load Policy Comments event is invoked by the Group Policy Registry Administrative plug-in to
read policy comments.

<gpo path>: Identifies the file path component of the GPO where the comments are stored.

Policy Comment State: The value of the comments in the GPO as described in Policy Comment
State (section 3.1.1.5).

This event causes the Policy Administration Comments Load Message Sequence (section 3.1.5.5) to be
performed using the <gpo path> and Policy Comment State logical parameters from this event.

##### 3.1.4.4 Update Policy Comments Event

The Update Policy Comments event is invoked by the Group Policy Registry Administrative plug-in to
update policy comments. The logical parameters are:

<gpo path>: Identifies the file path in which GPO settings are stored.

Policy Comment State: The value of the comments to be stored as described in Policy Comment
State (section 3.1.1.5).

This event causes the Policy Administration Comment Update Message Sequence (section 3.1.5.6) to
be performed using the <gpo path> and the Policy Comment State logical parameters from this
event.

##### 3.1.4.5 ADM-Based Policy Description Load Event

The ADM-Based Policy Description Load event is invoked by the Group Policy Registry Administrative
plug-in to load ADM-Based Administrative Templates. The logical parameters are:

<gpo path>: Identifies the GPO from which to load the template files.

This event causes the Policy Description Sequence for ADM-Based Administrative
Templates (section 3.1.5.1) to be performed using the <gpo path> logical parameter from this event.

##### 3.1.4.6 ADMX-Based Policy Description Load Event

The ADMX-Based Policy Description Load event is invoked by the Group Policy Registry Administrative
plug-in to load ADMX-Based Administrative Templates.

This event causes the Policy Description Sequence for ADMX-Based Administrative
Templates (section 3.1.5.2) to be performed.

#### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

Messages MUST be processed in the order of these subsections: 3.1.5.1 and/or 3.1.5.2 in any order,
and 3.1.5.3 followed by 3.1.5.4 if applicable. The administrative plug-in executes the Policy
Description Sequence for ADM-Based Administrative Templates and the Policy Description Sequence
for ADMX-Based Administrative Templates. All administrative template settings created by the
execution of the Policy Description Sequence for ADM-Based Administrative Templates and the Policy
Description Sequence for ADMX-Based Administrative Templates are serialized to and deserialized
from the registry.pol file. The sequencing of the Policy Description Sequence for ADM-Based
Administrative Templates and the Policy Description Sequence for ADMX-Based Administrative
Templates can therefore occur in any order. When an administrator loads any Registry Policy Setting,
the Policy Administration Load Message Sequencing is executed by the administrative plug-in. When

24 / 81

[MS-GPREG] - v20240423
Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


an administrator makes a change to any Registry Policy Setting, the Policy Administration Update
Message Sequencing is executed by the administrative plug-in.

##### 3.1.5.1 Policy Description Sequences for ADM-Based Administrative Templates

A Group Policy server MAY store serialized versions of Policy Description Messages in the GPO for use
with administrative plug-ins.<7>

ADM Policy Descriptions on the server MUST be updated by the administrative plug-in as follows:

1.  Perform a remote File Search from administrative tool to server: The search used MUST be "<gpo

path>\adm\*.adm".

2.  The tool MUST locally create a list of paths from the results returned from the search.

3.  The tool MUST then close the File Search.

4.  For each of the files in the list, the file MUST be read with the following sequences:

1.  Perform a remote File Open for the file. If the Open request returns a failure status, the Group

Policy: Registry Extension Encoding sequence MUST be terminated.

2.  If the time stamp of the file is later than a locally cached version of the file with the same

name, remote file reads MUST occur until all the contents of the file are read or an error
occurs. The protocol sequence MUST be terminated if an error occurs.

3.  If the file's time stamp is earlier or the file does not exist, then the administrative tool MAY
update the GPO itself with the locally cached version of the file so that other administrators
accessing the GPO can have access to a more recent version of the file.

4.  The administrative tool MUST read the locally cached version of the file to get information

about policy settings.

5.  A File Close MUST occur for the file.

The steps listed in this section SHOULD be used when administrative plug-ins are used to view or edit
administrative templates settings. Within all loaded ADM files, settings MUST be unique within the
CLASS, CATEGORY, and POLICY sections.<8>

##### 3.1.5.2 Policy Description Sequences for ADMX-Based Administrative Templates

When the ADMX Policy Description format is used, administrative templates SHOULD exist on the
administrator's computer. If the administrative templates also exist on the Group Policy server, the
administrative tool SHOULD ignore the local files in favor of versions of the files stored on the Group
Policy server. The ADMX Policy Description files on the server MAY<9> be updated by the
administrative plug-in or updated via some other method.

1.  A remote File Search from Administrative tool to Server: The search used MUST be "\\<dns

domain name>\sysvol\<dns domain name>\Policies\policydefinitions\". Note that this path is not
part of a GPO; it is global to the domain and is used to obtain ADMX files for administration of
any GPOs in the domain.

2.  The administrative tool MUST locally create a list of paths from the results returned from the

search.

3.  The File Search MUST be closed by the administrative tool.

4.  For each of the files in the list, the file MUST be read with the following sequences:

1.  A remote File Open occurs for the file with Shared Read permissions.

25 / 81

[MS-GPREG] - v20240423
Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


2.  Remote file reads occur until all the contents of the file are read or an error occurs.

3.  A File Close occurs for the file.

4.  If the namespace specified in the policyNamespaces:target element of the file has been loaded

within a previous file, this file MUST be ignored. For example, in this target element "<target
prefix='wuau' namespace='Microsoft.Policies.WindowsUpdate' />", the namespace
"Microsoft.Policies.WindowsUpdate" MUST be unique to one ADMX file. Identical policies MAY
appear in different namespaces.

5.  If a file was loaded during the Policy Description Sequences for ADM-Based Administrative

Templates (section 3.1.5.1), which is listed in a supersededAdm element in this file, the ADM
file MUST be ignored. For example, in this supersededAdm element "<supersededAdm
fileName='wuau.adm' />". The contents of "wuau.adm" are indicated to be superseded by this
file and MUST be ignored. There is no additional reconciliation between policies defined within
ADM files and policies defined within ADMX files.

##### 3.1.5.3 Policy Administration Load Message Sequencing

To load the registry-based policy settings from a Group Policy Object (GPO) using an administrative
plug-in, the Computer Policy Setting State (section 3.1.1.3) and User Policy Setting
State (section 3.1.1.4) of that GPO on the Group Policy server MUST be read with a new Registry
Policy Message. This MUST be accomplished with the following message sequence:

1.  Remote File Open from Administrative tool to Server: The file name used MUST be "<gpo

path>\registry.pol", where <gpo path> is one of the following:





The user-scoped Group Policy Object path, if the GPO's user settings are being updated.

The computer-scoped Group Policy Object path, if the computer settings are being
updated.

The remote File Open MUST request Shared Read permission and request that if the file does not
exist, it will not be created. If the Open request returns a failure status, the Group Policy: Registry
Extension Encoding sequence MUST be terminated.

2.  File Read Sequences: The administrative plug-in MUST perform a series of file reads to read the

contents of the opened registry.pol file. These reads MUST continue until the entire file is read or
an error is encountered. If an error is encountered, the protocol sequence MUST be terminated.

3.  File Close: The tool MUST then issue a File Close operation for all opened files.

##### 3.1.5.4 Policy Administration Update Message Sequencing

To update the registry-based policy settings in a GPO using an administrative plug-in, the Computer
Policy Setting State (section 3.1.1.3) and User Policy Setting State (section 3.1.1.4) of that GPO on
the Group Policy server MUST be updated with a new Registry Policy Message. This MUST be
accomplished with the following message sequence:

1.  Open registry.pol. This is a remote File Open from Administrative tool to Server: The file name

used MUST be "<gpo path>\registry.pol", where <gpo path> is one of the following:





The user-scoped Group Policy Object path if the GPO's user settings are being updated.

The computer-scoped GPO path if the computer settings are being updated.

The remote File Open MUST request Exclusive Write permission, and request that if the file does
not exist it will be created. If the Open request returns a failure status, the Group Policy: Registry
Extension Encoding sequence MUST be terminated.

26 / 81

[MS-GPREG] - v20240423
Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


2.  Remote File Write Sequences: The administrative plug-in MUST perform a series of remote file
writes to overwrite the contents of the opened registry.pol file with new settings. These writes
MUST continue until the entire file is copied or an error is encountered. If an error is encountered,
the protocol sequence MUST be terminated.

3.  File Close: The tool MUST then issue a file close operation for all opened files.

4.  If the Policy Administration Update Message is invoked from the Group Policy Registry

Administrative Plug-in, the administrative plug-in MUST invoke the Group Policy Extension Update
event described in [MS-GPOL] section 3.3.4.4 with the following parameters:

  GPO DN is set to the distinguished name of the Administered GPO.



"Is User Policy" is set to TRUE if changes were made to the GPO's user settings or FALSE if
changes were made to the GPO's computer settings.

  CSE GUID is set to the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding CSE GUID (defined in

section 1.9.



TOOL GUID is set to the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding TOOL GUID (defined in
section 1.9.

##### 3.1.5.5 Policy Administration Comments Load Message Sequencing

To load the registry-based policy comments from a Group Policy Object (GPO) using an
administrative plug-in, the Policy Comment State (section 3.1.1.5) of that GPO on the Group Policy
server MUST be read with a new Policy Comment Message (section 2.2.3). This MUST be accomplished
with the following message sequence:

1.  Remote File Open from Administrative tool to Server: The file name used MUST be "<gpo

path>\comment.cmtx", where <gpo path> is one of the following:





The user-scoped Group Policy Object path if the GPO's user settings are being updated.

The computer-scoped Group Policy Object path if the computer settings are being
updated.

The remote File Open MUST request Shared Read permissions and MUST specify that the file is
not to be created if it does not exist. If the Open request returns a failure status, the Policy
Administration Comments Load Message sequence MUST be terminated.

2.  Remote File Open from Administrative tool to Server: The file name used MUST be "<gpo

path>\<language locale name>\comment.cmtl", where <language locale name> is in the format
language-locale (for example, en-us or fr-fr) and <gpo path> is one of the following:





The user-scoped Group Policy Object path if the user settings of the GPO are being updated.

The computer-scoped Group Policy Object path if the computer settings are being updated.

The File Open MUST request Shared Read permission and request that if the file does not exist it
will not be created. If the Open request returns a failure status, the Policy Administration
Comments Load Message sequence MUST continue with step 3, File Read Sequences.

3.  If the comment.cmtx file is opened, the administrative plug-in MUST perform a series of remote

file reads to read the contents of the opened comment.cmtx file. These reads MUST continue until
the entire file is read or an error is encountered. If an error is encountered, the protocol sequence
MUST be terminated.

If the comment.cmtl file is opened, the administrative plug-in MUST perform a series of remote file
reads to read the contents of the opened comment.cmtl file. These reads MUST continue until the

entire file is read or an error is encountered. If an error is encountered, the protocol sequence
MUST be terminated.

4.  File Close: The tool MUST then issue a File Close operation for all opened files.

##### 3.1.5.6 Policy Administration Comment Update Message Sequencing

To update the registry-based comment settings in a Group Policy Object using an administrative plug-
in, the Policy Comment State (section 3.1.1.5) of that Group Policy Object (GPO) on the Group
Policy server MUST be updated with a new Policy Comment Message (section 2.2.3). This MUST be
accomplished with the following message sequence:

1.  Remote File Open from Administrative tool to Server: The file name used MUST be "<gpo

path>\comment.cmtx", where <gpo path> is one of the following:





The user-scoped Group Policy Object path if the GPO's user settings are being updated.

The computer-scoped Group Policy Object path if the computer settings are being
updated.

The remote File Open MUST request Exclusive Write permissions and MUST specify that the file is
not to be created if it does not exist. If the Open request returns a failure status, the Policy
Administration Comment Update Message sequence MUST be terminated.

A .cmtl file is never created or updated as part of the Policy Administration Comment Update
Message Sequencing. Language-specific .cmtl files are manually created and shipped as part of
the operating system to provide localization for the comments that describe sample Group Policy
Objects.

When an administrator adds a comment to a GPO, a .cmtx file is created or updated, but no .cmtl
is created. To provide language-specific comments, an administrator MUST manually create the
.cmtl file in the appropriate language-specific folder and edit the .cmtx manually so that it will
refer to the language-specific string resources in the .cmtl file. For steps about manually localizing
.cmtx files, see Policy Administration Comment Localization Message Sequencing (section 3.1.5.7).

2.  Remote File Write Sequences: The administrative plug-in MUST perform a series of remote file
writes to overwrite the contents of the opened comment.cmtx  file with new comments. These
writes MUST continue until the entire file is copied or an error is encountered. If an error is
encountered, the protocol sequence MUST be terminated.

3.  File Close: The tool MUST then issue a file close operation for all opened files.

##### 3.1.5.7 Policy Administration Comment Localization Message Sequencing

1.  An Administrator MAY choose to localize the comments for a GPO. The Administrator MUST edit
the .cmtx file at "<gpo path>\comment.cmtx", where <gpo path> is one of the following:





The user-scoped Group Policy Object path if the comment applies to a GPO's user settings.

The computer-scoped GPO path if the comment applies to a GPO's computer settings.

2.  A .cmtx file applies to a single GPO and MAY contain many comments. A .cmtx file by default

created or updated by an Administrative plug-in will contain a <stringTable> within the .cmtx file.
In the following example .cmtx file, there are comments on two GPO settings indicated by the two
comment elements.

The Administrator MUST not save the .cmtx file until the .cmtl file is created.

4.  The Administrator MUST create or update a .cmtl file. The file name used MUST be "<gpo

path>\<language locale name>\comment.cmtl", where <language locale name> is in the format
language-locale (for example, en-us or fr-fr) and <gpo path> is one of the following:





The user-scoped Group Policy Object path if the user settings of the GPO are being updated.

The computer-scoped Group Policy Object path if the computer settings are being updated.

5.  The Administrator MUST copy into the .cmtl file the default .cmtl xml header and

<commentDefinitionResources> element, the resources element, and the <stringTable> removed
from the .cmtx file, resulting in the following document.

6.  The Administrator MUST save the .cmtl file.

7.  The Administrator MUST save the .cmtx file. Additional language-specific files MAY be created by

repeating steps 4 and 5 as needed and editing the string values. By default, if a .cmtl language-
specific file is not located for the current language, the Administrative plug-in MUST attempt to
locate the language-specific .cmtl file for language-locale en-us. If the .cmtl file for language-
locale en-us is not located, the Administrative plug-in MUST signal an error but MUST NOT prevent
the GPO from loading in the Administrative plug-in.

##### 3.1.5.8 Policy Administration for Network Access Protection

This section describes the Network Access Protection administrative plug-in.

The Network Access Protection policy settings are data structures defined in [MS-GPNAP]. They are
registry settings and are administered by the Group Policy: Network Access Protection protocol
administrative plug-in. The Network Access Protection administrative plug-in queries and persists
these settings in the registry.pol registry policy file under the computer-scoped Group Policy
Object path.

The NAP Group Policy administrative plug-in MUST invoke the following event to load the registry.pol
file:

1.  Load Policy Settings Event (section 3.1.4.1).

The NAP Group Policy administrative plug-in MUST invoke the following events to update the
registry.pol file:

1.  Update Policy Settings Event (section 3.1.4.2).

2.  Update Group Policy Extension event specified in [MS-GPOL] section 3.3.4.4 with the following

parameters:

  GPO DN is set to the distinguished name of the Administered GPO (the GPO targeted by the

Network Access Protection (NAP) administrative plug-in)



"Is User Policy" is set to FALSE.

  CSE GUID is set to the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding CSE GUID (defined in

section 1.9).



TOOL GUID is set to the Group Policy: Network Access Protection Tool extension GUID
(defined in [MS-GPNAP] section 1.7).

In both cases, <gpo path> is set to the computer-scoped Group Policy Object path (the GPO path
targeted by the Network Access Protection administrative plug-in), and the settings contained in the
registry.pol file are used for the Policy Setting State. No other policy files are accessed by this plug-in.
The plug-in MUST use the registry policy file format specified in section 2.2.1 to query and update the
policy entries described in [MS-GPNAP] section 2 in the registry.pol file.

### 3.2 Client Plug-in Details

#### 3.2.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation
maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the
explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations
adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this
document.

##### 3.2.1.1 Policy Setting State

The Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding client plug-in itself maintains no state. However, it is
assumed that a local database of settings (registry) exists that can be updated by the client plug-in.

  Registry:

 Database assumed to be a list of records, each with a key or a record identifier. In addition to
the key, each record has a list of name/value pairs, and each value has a type. The database
SHOULD support concurrent Read/Write operations and SHOULD apply Write transactions on a
first-come/first-serve basis while allowing concurrent Read/Write operations. Access to
name/value pairs for a deleted key SHOULD be read-only until the delete operation is
completed.

The protocol models a set of actions to take on that database so that clients can respond to the
resulting database. The model is as follows:

  Database Scope:

 The Database Scope identifies what database on the client is affected by any operation. The
client maintains separate databases for the client operating system itself, and it maintains one
for each user account that logs on interactively to the computer. When the protocol is processed
as part of Computer Policy Mode, all operations described here occur as part of the operating
system's scope. For User Policy Mode, all operations described here occur as part of the scope
for the user account of the Policy Target.

  Database OperationList:

[MS-GPREG] - v20240423
Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

31 / 81


 A list of Database Operations to take on the database.

  Database Operation:

 A Database key and a Key Operation.

  Database Key:

 A unique identifier in the database. This key is determined by a specific application vendor. It is
assumed that other components on the client will look for this key in the database to check for
actions for that process.

  Key Operation:

 An action and a Value List. The client plug-in is to take the action against that key for the
values in the Value List. The operations allowed are to add values and delete values.

  Value List:

 A list of Name Value Pairs.

  Name Value Pair:

 A Value Name and a Policy Value.

  Value Name:

 A name defined by some application or system component vendor and used by the application
or component on the client to obtain a value that signifies the behavior it is to adopt to conform
to the administrator's policy.



Policy Value:

 A Data Type and a Data Value.

  Data Type:

 The commonly understood concept of data type that describes how the Data Value is to be
interpreted, whether as a string, integer, multiple-valued string, or a binary stream.

  Data Value:

 Physical data that is to be interpreted according to the Data Type specification. It is assumed
that other components on the client will act on this interpretation of the Data Value to determine
its behavior.

##### 3.2.1.2 Impersonation Token

A token used to impersonate a user.

#### 3.2.2 Timers

None.

#### 3.2.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

##### 3.2.4.1 Process Group Policy

This extension is launched by the Group Policy: Core Protocol, which invokes this Process Group Policy
event, whose abstract interface is specified in [MS-GPOL] section 3.2.4.1, to apply policies handled by
this extension. The SecurityToken abstract interface argument is saved in the Impersonation
Token abstract data model element.

#### 3.2.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

##### 3.2.5.1 Registry Policy Message Sequencing

###### 3.2.5.1.1 Deleted GPO List Processing

This protocol does not process the Deleted GPO list.

###### 3.2.5.1.2 New or Changed GPO List Processing

For each Group Policy Object in the New or Changed GPO list (as specified in section 3.2.1.2), one
Registry Policy Message will be read from the Group Policy server, as specified in the following
paragraphs. If any message cannot be read, the message sequence MUST be terminated; this means
that no further Registry Policy Messages can be exchanged during this instance of the Policy
Application mode sequence.

The following message sequence MUST occur for each <gpo path> that the Group Policy: Core
Protocol has determined contains registry settings. This sequence attempts to retrieve a Registry
Policy Message for a given <gpo path>:

1.  For User Policy Mode, the Impersonation Token abstract data model element SHOULD be used

to impersonate the user for all file operations in this sequence.

2.  Remote File Open from Client to Server: The file that MUST be used is "<gpo

path>\User\registry.pol" for User Policy Mode and "<gpo path>\Machine\registry.pol" for
Computer Policy Mode. The remote File Open MUST request Shared Read permission. If the Open
request returns a failure status, the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding sequence MUST be
terminated.

3.  Remote File Read Sequences: The client MUST then perform a series of remote file reads until

either the entire contents of the opened file are obtained or an error occurs. If an error occurs, the
Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding sequence MUST be terminated.

4.  File Close: The client MUST then issue a file close operation.

5.  For User Policy Mode, impersonation SHOULD be terminated.

After all messages have been retrieved, the client MUST update its registry according to the following
specified rules. If the signature check of the registry.pol file fails, the file is invalid and MUST be
skipped. Any errors writing to this database MUST be ignored.<10> There is no surfacing of such
ignored errors to other protocols, so the Group Policy: Core Protocol as a whole will be unaffected by
errors in updating the local database.



For each Instruction found in the file, create the Database Key using the Key in the Instruction.
Under this key, create a record with:





The Value Name from the Value in the Instruction.

The Value Type from the Type found in the Instruction.

Release: April 23, 2024




The Data found in the Instruction for DataValue.

  However, if the Value Name is one of the following, follow the rules in the table instead. Note that
the Value Name listed in the table is case-insensitive but otherwise MUST be taken literally except
where a replacement token in angle brackets is specified. In these special cases, the Type MUST
be REG_SZ except in the **SecureKey case, where it MUST be REG_DWORD and
**soft.<valuename> where Type is unrestricted.

 Value Name

 Meaning

**DeleteValues

A semicolon-delimited list of values to delete, specified under DataValue.

 Example: In the following example, the values EnableURL and TabURL are deleted.

 Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\Communicator

 Value Name: **DeleteValues

 Type: REG_SZ

 DataValue: "EnableURL;TabURL"

**Del.<valuename>   Deletes the value <valuename>. In this case, DataValue is ignored but MUST

contain a null-terminated string with a single space character.

 Example: In the following example, the value ShowPoliciesOnly is deleted.

 Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Group Policy Editor

 Value Name: **Del.ShowPoliciesOnly

 Type: REG_SZ

 DataValue: " "

**DelVals.

Deletes all values in the key. In this case, DataValue is ignored but MUST contain a
null-terminated string with a single space character.

 Example: In the following example, all the values under the Run key are deleted.

 Key: Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run

 Value Name: **DelVals.

 Type: REG_SZ

 DataValue: " "

**DeleteKeys

A semicolon-delimited list of keys that are immediate subkeys of this key to delete.

 Example: In the following example, the subkeys NoRun and NoFind under the Run
key are deleted.

 Key: Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run

 Value Name: **DeleteKeys

 Type: REG_SZ

 DataValue: "NoRun;NoFind"

**SecureKey

 A DataValue of 1 secures the key, giving administrators and the system full control
and giving users read-only access.

 Any other DataValue except as mentioned above resets access to the key to
whatever is set on the HKCU for User and on the HKLM for Computer.

 Example: In the following example, the Run key is secured so that administrators
and the system have full control, whereas users have read-only access.

 Key: Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run

 Value Name: **SecureKey

 Type: REG_DWORD

 DataValue: 1

**soft.<valuename>  Create the value <valuename> if it does not exist.

1.  Example: In this example, the value ApplyPolicies is created only if the

[MS-GPREG] - v20240423
Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

34 / 81


 Value Name

 Meaning

ApplyPolicies value does not exist.

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Group Policy Editor

Value Name: **soft.ApplyPolicies

Type: REG_DWORD

DataValue: 1

2.  Example: In this example, the value RootPath is created only if the RootPath

value does not exist.

Key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Group Policy Editor

Value Name: **soft.RootPath

Type: REG_SZ

DataValue: %PROGRAMFILES%



The Instruction elements MUST be processed in the order in which they occur, sequentially from
the start of the Registry Policy message. The necessity of this is demonstrated by an example in
which an Instruction requires a database value to be set to 1 and another Instruction requires it to
be set to 0. Depending on the order in which those instructions are performed, the final value will
be either 1 or 0. To ensure predictable operation, Instructions MUST be performed sequentially,
beginning with the first Instruction in the Registry Policy message.

Applications that query this database for behavior after the Group Policy: Registry Extension Encoding
invocation can then conform to the specified settings.

#### 3.2.6 Timer Events

None.

#### 3.2.7 Other Local Events

None.

### 3.3 Interpretation of Registry Policy Messages as Policies by an Adminstration Tool

Policy Description Messages map policy behaviors to registry keys and values, and Registry Policy
Messages describe registry keys and values. Therefore, the Policy Description Messages can map
policies to any key/value pairs in the Registry Policy Messages that are also referenced within the
Policy Description Messages. Because of this, the Policy Description Messages can be used by a tool to
determine what Administrative Template Policy behaviors have been set in the Registry Policy
Messages (that is, what Administrative Template Policies are set for this GPO).

This also means that a tool can use the Policy Description Messages to serialize a policy behavior
described in the Policy Description Message. This is because the Policy Description Message describes
what key and value to set to generate a different behavior. A tool could create a Registry Policy
Message with that key and value, and then update a GPO through a Registry Policy Update sequence.
The updating of a GPO through a Registry Policy Update sequence occurs within a tool. A Registry
Policy Message is consumed both by a tool to create or update a GPO and by a client to apply policy
on the client.

## 4 Protocol Examples

### 4.1 Registry Policy Application Message

The following is an example registry settings message that instructs the client to set the Database
Key Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System\ with the Name Value Pair "LocalProfile", 1 with the
Data Type REG_DWORD for the operating system account's Database Scope. It also instructs the
client to set the Database Key Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System\ with the Name Value Pair
"GroupPolicyMinTransferRate", 0 with the Data Type REG_DWORD in the Database Scope for the
operating system account. The descriptions of when Computer Policy Mode is used versus when User
Policy Mode is used are described in 1.3.2.

1.  Remote file open for the file <gpo path>\Machine\Registry.pol.

2.  A series of remote file read requests and replies to read the registry settings. The entire file is

read by the client. Figure 2 shows the contents of the <gpo path>\Machine\Registry.pol file.

3.  File close.

4.  After the data has been read by the client in step 2, the client updates its registry according to the

rules specified in 3.2.5. Any error in updating the registry is ignored.

Figure 2: Contents of <gpo path>\Machine\Registry.pol

### 4.2 Policy Administration Update Message

The following is an example user registry settings message that an administrator wants to set on the
client, Database Key Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System with the Name
Value Pair "HideLogonScripts", 1 with the Data Type REG_DWORD for the user account's Database
Scope. The descriptions of when Computer Policy Mode is used versus when User Policy Mode is used
are described in 1.3.2.

1.  Perform a remote File Open for the file <gpo path>\User\Registry.pol. The remote File Open

requests Exclusive Write permission and requests that if the file does not exist it be created. If the
Open request returns a failure status, the update process is terminated.

2.  A series of remote file read requests and replies to read the registry settings. The entire file is

read by the administrative plug-in tool.

3.  In case this value that the administrator is trying to configure exists, the existing values are

displayed in the administrative plug-in tool; otherwise, the settings that the administrator is trying
to configure are displayed as not configured in the administrative plug-in tool.

4.  The administrative plug-in then performs a series of remote file writes to overwrite the contents of
the opened file with new settings, as shown in the following figure. These writes continue until the
entire file is copied or an error is encountered. If an error is encountered, the protocol sequence is
terminated.

5.  The administrative plug-in then issues a file close to close the file.

## 5 Security

### 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

Do not transmit passwords or other sensitive data through this protocol. The primary reason for this
restriction is that the protocol provides no encryption, and therefore sensitive data transmitted
through this protocol can be intercepted easily by an unauthorized user with access to the network
carrying the data. For example, if a network administrator configured a Group Policy: Registry
Extension Encoding setting in a GPO to instruct a computer to use a specific password when accessing
a certain network resource, this protocol would send that password unencrypted to those computers.
A person gaining unauthorized access, intercepting the protocol's network packets in this case, would
then discover the password for that resource that would then be unprotected from the unauthorized
person.

### 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

There are no security parameters associated with this protocol.

## 6 Appendix A: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental
software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

  Windows NT operating system

  Windows 2000 operating system

  Windows XP operating system

  Windows Server 2003 operating system

  Windows Vista operating system

  Windows Server 2008 operating system

  Windows 7 operating system

  Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system

  Windows 8 operating system

  Windows Server 2012 operating system

  Windows 8.1 operating system

  Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system

  Windows 10 operating system

  Windows Server 2016 operating system

  Windows Server operating system

  Windows Server 2019 operating system

  Windows Server 2022 operating system

  Windows 11 operating system

  Windows Server 2025 operating system

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base
(KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior
also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the
product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed
using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the
SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the
product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.9: The Tool Extension GUID value of {0F6B957E-509E-11D1-A7CC-0000F87571E3}
and {0F6B957D-509E-11D1-A7CC-0000F87571E3} for User and Computer respectively are written to
the GPO by the Administrative Plug-In tools that is part of the following releases of Windows:

  Windows Server 2003

  Windows Vista

<2> Section 1.9: When a GPO is modified, the Tool Extension GUID value of {D02B1F73-3407-48AE-
BA88-E8213C6761F1} and {D02B1F72-3407-48AE-BA88-E8213C6761F1} for User and Computer
respectively are written to the GPO by the Administrative Plug-In tools. These tools are not included in
the following releases of Windows:

  Windows NT

  Windows 2000

  Windows XP

  Windows Server 2003

  Windows Vista

<3> Section 2.2.1: Windows can only interpret substrings of the string data of type 0x02 as a system
environment variable if those substrings are enclosed by two "%" characters. This does not affect how
the data is stored in the local registry by the protocol; but applications on the client that query for
this data from the local registry attempt to resolve the environment variables for data of this type to
correctly enforce the behavior of the policy setting represented by the value.

<4> Section 2.2.2.1.1: The supported ADM version value for policy administration plug-ins shipped
with Windows is as follows:

  Windows 95 operating system: Version value of 1.

  Windows NT Server 4.0 operating system: Version values in the range of 1 to 2.

  Windows 2000: Version values in the range of 1 to 3.

  Windows XP (prior to Windows XP operating system Service Pack 1 (SP1)): Version values in the

range of 1 to 4.

  All other releases of Windows: Version values in the range of 1 to 5.

<5> Section 2.2.2.2: ADM files are not supported in Windows NT and Windows 2000. ADMX files are
not supported by Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003.

<6> Section 2.2.3: CMTX and CMTL files are not supported by Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows
XP, and Windows Server 2003.

<7> Section 3.1.5.1: Windows Policy Administration tools store the policy description messages in the
GPO. This enables administrators on other computers using similar tools to administer the GPO
without having the Policy Description Messages available on the other computers. The administrative
tools can use the Policy Description Messages in the GPO.

<8> Section 3.1.5.1: Windows administrative tools that use this protocol update the GPO with a
locally cached version of ADM files as described previously if the time stamp on the locally cached
version is greater than the version in the GPO or does not exist.

<9> Section 3.1.5.2: Windows administrative plug-in does not support any kind of update to the
ADMX files. However, steps 1-4 in this section are supported only in Windows Vista, Windows Server
2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system.

<10> Section 3.2.5.1.2: Windows ignores errors writing to the local database and continues to the
registry protocol sequence even when such failures occur.

SupportedOnReference

SupportedOnTable
(PolicyDefinitions)

Of type SupportedOnReference. A policy can have a
SupportedOnReference defined that refers to a specific
SupportedOnDefinition defined in the SupportedOnTable or a
SupportedProduct defined in the SupportedProducts. When used as a
SupportedOnReference, this element is always associated with a single
policy, although the reference value can be used for multiple policies.

Definition of targeting rules represented by a logical name and a
displayName attribute via SupportedOrCondition and
SupportedAndCondition elements. The displayName attribute are a
linguistic representation of the complex SupportedOnDefinition. In the
example in section 4.4.1, the definition for
SUPPORTED_Sample_1_AND_SAMPLE_2 lists two products wrapped in an
"and" element to indicate that both products are expected and the
definition SUPPORTED_MIXED that lists a product and a product range
wrapped in an "or" element to indicate that either is true.

Table of supported components definitions.

Supported version range for a contiguous sequence of
SupportedMajorVersion or SupportedMinorVersion elements. The ref
attribute of type itemReference is a reference to a SupportedProduct
containing SupportedMajorVersion elements or a
SupportedMajorVersion containing SupportedMinorVersion elements
representing a list of available product versions. The versionIndex
attribute on the SupportedMajorVersion or SupportedMinorVersion
is greater than or equal to the minVersionIndex attribute and less than
or equal to the maxVersionIndex attribute for inclusion in the
SupportedOnRange.

Reference to a SupportedOnDefinition (single version or complex
definition) or SupportedProduct. In the example in section 4.4.1, the
Sample_Actionlist policy contains a reference to SupportedOnDefinition
SUPPORTED_Sample_1_AND_SAMPLE_2.

A table of potentially supported products and/or definitions. The example
in 4.4.1 contains a list of products and definitions. The supportedOn
feature can be used in an Administrative plug-in to display the list of
supported products or product combinations for which a policy can apply,
by using a SupportedOnReference defined on the policy to refer to a
specific SupportedOnDefinition or SupportedProduct defined in this
table. The list contains the displayName attribute of the
SupportedOnDefinition and SupportedProduct elements.

SupportedOrCondition
(SupportedOnDefinition)

A list of references to a supported product definition and/or range
elements where at least one is TRUE for the policy definition to be
supported.

SupportedProduct
(SupportedProducts)

(policyComments)

Description and Attributes

A comment.

policyRef: A reference to the policy setting defined in an ADMX file associated with

this comment.

commentText: Comment text that can be a reference to a language-specific string

resource.

Root element for string resources. Provides a container element for comments stored as
<string> elements in the <stringTable>. If a language-specific CMTL file is found,
comments are loaded from the <resources> element located in the CMTL file, and
resources in the CMTX file are ignored.

minRequiredVersion: Minimum required version, defined with major.minor

components (for example, "1.0"). For standalone CMTX files with no localized
content, the minRequiredVersion attribute is compared to the revision
attribute of the CMTX <policyComments> root element. Both have equal major
components, and the minor component of the revision attribute is greater than
or equal to the minor component of the minRequiredVersion attribute. For
CMTX files with language-specific CMTL files, the minRequiredVersion attribute
is compared to the revision attribute of the CMTL
<commentDefinitionResources> root element. Both have equal major
components, and the minor component of the revision attribute is greater than
or equal to the minor component of the minRequiredVersion attribute.

stringTable
(resources)

(optional) Root element for the <string> elements.

string (stringTable)

Language-specific string indexed by the "id" attribute.

id: A reference unique to all id values in this CMTX file, used as a lookup value.

1  Introduction

The IPv4 Over IEEE 1394 (IPo1394) protocol is described by the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF), and is specified in [RFC2734]. The IPo1394 protocol specifies the necessary methods, data
structures, and codes to send IPv4 datagrams over IEEE 1394 links (as specified in [IEEE1394]).
Specifically, the protocol describes packet formats, encapsulation methods for IPv4 datagrams, the
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) (1394 ARP), and the Multicast Channel Allocation Protocol (MCAP).

IPo1394 protocol does not support sending Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol (STP) frames and
bridging. This document specifies an extension to the IPv4 Over IEEE 1394 (IPo1394) protocol to
support bridging in networked environments. This document also clarifies the implementation details
of [RFC2734] where necessary.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

1.1  Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

Extended Unique Identifier - 48 (EUI-48): A 48-bit number defined by the IEEE as a

concatenation of a 24-bit Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) value administered by the
IEEE Registration Authority, and a 24-bit extension identifier assigned by the organization with
that OUI assignment.

Extended Unique Identifier - 64 (EUI-64): A 64-bit number defined by the IEEE as a

concatenation of the 24-bit Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) value administered by the
IEEE Registration Authority, and a 40-bit extension identifier assigned by the organization with
that OUI assignment.

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

1.2  References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the
most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents
in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not
match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the Errata.

1.2.1  Normative References

1.3  Overview

The IPv4 over IEEE 1394 protocol (IPo1394) is used to transport IPv4 (as specified in [RFC791])
datagrams over the high Performance Serial Bus (as specified in [IEEE1394]). The primary use of the
IPv4 over IEEE 1394 protocol, as specified in [RFC2734], is to connect two devices via a 1394 bus and
to allow sending and receiving of IP traffic across the 1394 bus.

The IPv4 Over IEEE 1394 Protocol Extensions specified in this document allow IPo1394 to be used in
bridged network environments. The following figure depicts an example scenario where two networks
are bridged—one network that uses the IPo1394 protocol, and the other that uses the Ethernet
protocol. The bridge allows Device 1 to communicate with Device 2 as if they were on the same link.
Bridging is specified in [IEEE802.1D]. The prevention of loops requires the ability to transmit Spanning
Tree Algorithm and Protocol (STP) frames (as specified in [IEEE802.1D] sections 8 and 9) over the
bridged media to support the Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA) in the bridge. However, the IPo1394
protocol, as specified in [RFC2734], does not support sending STP frames.

The extension specified in this document provides a means for STP frames to be sent over IPo1394
and simply defines a way for STP to be encapsulated over 1394. This extension introduces no new
state or bridging behavior.

1.4  Relationship to Other Protocols

IPv4 Over IEEE 1394 (IPo1394) Protocol relates to other protocols only insofar as those protocols run
over IPv4, which in turn can run over IPo1394. The extensions specified in this document do not affect
other protocols.

The following figure depicts IPo1394 and its relationship to the other higher and lower-layer protocols
mentioned in this document. Sending and receiving 1394 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and IPv4
datagrams request and response packets over IPo1394 is specified in [RFC2734].

Sending and receiving Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol (STP) packets over IPo1394 is specified
in this document. The IPo1394 extension supports the transmitting and receiving of STP packets and
is used by the STP protocol, as specified in [IEEE802.1D] sections 8 and 9. STP is implemented in the
bridge component and is used to detect and prevent network loops.<1>

Figure 2: Protocol stack showing IPo1394 and its relationship to other protocols

Sending and receiving Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) packets, as specified in
[RFC2131], over IPo1394 is specified in [RFC2855]. IPo1394 uses a different link-layer addressing
method than conventional 802.3/Ethernet. For more information, see [IEEE802.3]. This implies that
the use of some fields in DHCP packets has to be clarified to achieve interoperability between
implementations of IPo1394 and DHCP. DHCP for IEEE 1394, as specified in [RFC2855], specifies the
IPo1394 use of these fields in DHCP packets.<2>

1.5  Prerequisites/Preconditions

The IPv4 Over IEEE 1394 Protocol Extensions do not add any new prerequisites or preconditions
beyond those specified in [RFC2734].

1.6  Applicability Statement

The extension described herein does not change the applicability of the IPo1394 protocol, with one
notable exception. IPo1394, as specified in [RFC2734], does not support bridging. The extension

described in this document allows bridging to operate in a network that contains one or more 1394
links.<3>

1.7  Versioning and Capability Negotiation

None.

1.8  Vendor-Extensible Fields

The IPv4 Over IEEE 1394 Protocol Extensions do not introduce any new vendor-extensible fields
beyond those specified in [RFC2734] section 10.

1.9  Standards Assignments

The new value of 0x0777 for ether_type, as specified in Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol (STP)
packet (section 2.2.1), was chosen by Microsoft but is not yet reserved by the IEEE Registration
Authority.

2  Messages

The following sections specify how IPv4 Over IEEE 1394 Protocol Extensions messages are transported
and gives details on the message syntax.

2.1  Transport

The IPo1394 transport, as specified in [RFC2734], is not changed by this protocol extension.

2.2  Message Syntax

Except as specified in the Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol (STP) packet (section 2.2.1), the
message syntax for the IPo1394 protocol remains unchanged from the base protocol as specified in
[RFC2734] section 4.2.

2.2.1  STP Packet

The Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol (STP) (as specified in [IEEE802.1D] sections 8 and 9) is
used to detect network loops. The extension specified in this document extends IPo1394 to support
the transmission and reception of the STP packet. The actual network loop detection is performed by
STP—a higher-layer protocol—as specified in [IEEE802.1D] sections 8 and 9.

As shown below, an STP message on 1394 contains a standard IPo1394 header (the lf, reserved, and
ether_type fields), followed by a standard STP message.

0. This field MUST be ignored in a received packet.

ether_type (2 bytes): The possible values for this field MUST be one of the following:

Value  Meaning

0x0800  The rest of the packet is an IPv4 datagram, as specified in [RFC2734].

0x0806  The rest of the packet is an 1394 ARP message, as specified in [RFC2734].

0x8861  The rest of the packet is a Multicast Channel Allocation Protocol (MCAP) message, as specified in

[RFC2734].

0x0777  The rest of the packet is an STP packet, as specified in [IEEE802.1D]. This value was added by

Microsoft to indicate that an STP packet follows.

Received packets with an ether_type other than one of the above values are dropped.

3  Protocol Details

As specified in [RFC2734], IPo1394 is a point-to-point protocol used for transmitting IPv4 datagrams
over an IEEE 1394 high-performance serial bus.

3.1  Common Details

3.1.1  Abstract Data Model

No additional state is required beyond that in the base protocol, as specified in [RFC2734].<4>

3.1.2  Timers

No new timers are required beyond those in the base protocol, as specified in [RFC2734].<5>

3.1.3  Initialization

The Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol (STP) is unchanged from what is specified in [IEEE802.1D]
section 9, but because it expects EUI-48 addresses (as Ethernet uses), it is necessary to explain how
it uses addresses on 1394 media.

STP specifies how to generate a 64-bit Extended Unique Identifier - 64 (EUI-64) (as specified in
[IEEE802.1D] section 9) which is used as the bridge ID, from an EUI-48. 1394 uses an EUI-64 value
(as specified in [IEEE1394] section 8.3.2.5.7.1) instead of an EUI-48 value. As a result, at initialization
time, IPo1394 SHOULD generate an EUI-48 by using any local algorithm that generates a value that is
unique on the subnet, for use by STP when it needs to construct a bridge ID.<6>

No additional initialization is required beyond that in the base protocol, as specified in [RFC2734].<7>

3.1.4  Higher-Layer Triggered Events

No additional higher-layer triggered events exist beyond those in the base protocol, as specified in
[RFC2734]. The behavior of the existing higher-layer triggered events is as specified in sections
3.1.4.1 and 3.1.4.2.

3.1.4.1  Sending a UNICAST IPv4 Datagram

When IPv4 (as specified in [RFC791]) transmits a unicast IPv4 datagram, the behavior is unchanged
from what is specified in [RFC2734] section 7.<8>

3.1.4.2  Sending a MULTICAST IPv4 Datagram

An implementation of IPv4 over IEEE 1394 MAY use "multicast transmit" (as specified in [RFC2734]
sections 9 and 9.1) to send a multicast IPv4 datagram, or it MAY use the "IP Broadcast" to send a
multicast IPv4 datagram on the BROADCAST_CHANNEL, as specified in [RFC2734] section 8.<9>

3.1.4.3  Sending an STP Packet

IPo1394 MUST encapsulate the STP packet with the IPo1394 encapsulation header, as specified in
[RFC2734] section 4.2, and MUST set the value 0x0777 in the ether_type field present in the
encapsulation header. The STP protocol is unchanged from what is specified in [IEEE802.1D] section
9.

On Ethernet media, STP packets are sent to the Bridge Group Address (as specified in [IEEE802.1D]
section 9). When transmitted over 1394, STP packets MUST be sent on the 1394 broadcast channel
(as specified in [RFC2734] section 8).

3.1.5  Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

Except as noted in this section, the message processing and sequencing rules are unchanged from the
base protocol, as specified in [RFC2734].

3.1.5.1  Receiving an STP Packet

IPo1394 MUST correctly recognize the STP packet by recognizing the ether_type value in the packet
encapsulation header that has a value of 0x0777. The STP packet format is specified in section 2.2.1.
After receiving the STP packet, the IPo1394 protocol passes it up to the STP layer, which implements
the network loop detection logic, as specified in [IEEE802.1D].

3.1.5.2  Receiving a MULTICAST 1394 Frame

More information on the IPo1394 implementation of multicast frames is specified in [RFC2734] section
9.<10>

3.1.5.3  Receiving an Unrecognized Message

The rules for processing an unrecognized message are unchanged from what is specified in [RFC2734]
via [RFC791]. Specifically, an unrecognized message is dropped.

3.1.6  Timer Events

[RFC2734] specifies the 1394 ARP request/response packet format but it does not describe a
sequencing mechanism.<11>

3.1.7  Other Local Events

When a new IP address is acquired, the same actions are taken that are specified in section 3.1.3.

There are no other local events that affect the IPo1394 protocol.

4  Protocol Examples

The following figure shows a scenario where Device 1 is connected to Bridge 1 via IPo1394. Bridge 1 is
connected to Bridge 2 via IPo1394, and Bridge 2 is connected to Device 2 via Ethernet.

Figure 3: Scenario of four devices connected in a network

Consider the scenario outlined in the previous figure. Assume that all devices have already acquired
their IP addresses, and Bridge 1 and Bridge 2 implement the spanning tree algorithm (as specified in
[IEEE802.1D] section 8 and 9) for loop detection and termination. Also, assume that Bridge 2 is not
yet connected to Device 2.

1.  At initialization time, the IPo1394 components of Bridge 1 and Bridge 2 report link-layer addresses

of their 1394 interfaces up to higher-layer protocols. In this example, both Bridge 1 and Bridge 2
report an EUI-48 that has the Locally Administered bit set and the remaining bits generated
randomly. The Spanning Tree Algorithm Protocol (STP), being one of the higher-layer protocols,
uses the addresses of each interface to generate a Bridge Identifier, as specified in [IEEE802.1D]
section 8.5.3.7. Bridge 1 has only 1394 interfaces, so the Bridge Identifier is constructed from the
EUI-48 on the lowest numbered interface (as specified in [IEEE802.1D] section 7.12.5). Similarly,
Bridge 2 also constructs a Bridge Identifier from the address of its lowest numbered interface,
which in the example is its Ethernet interface.

2.  The Ethernet cable is first plugged into Bridge 2. This media change triggers the STP

implementation to send an STP packet on both interfaces in Bridge 2, as specified in [IEEE802.1D]
section 9. Therefore, the packet that appears on the 1394 cable looks like the following: Bridge 2
sends an STP packet on both interfaces—one using Ethernet to Device 2 and the other using
IPo1394 to Bridge 1. The format of the packet sent from Bridge 2 to Bridge 1 via IPo1394 follows:

0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

1
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

2
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

3
0  1

lf =
0x0

Reserved = 0x0

ether_type = 0x0777

Standard STP message (variable)

...

The preceding packet is sent on the 1394 broadcast channel, and the Bridge Identifier used by
STP is the one generated from its Ethernet media access control (MAC) address.

3.  Bridge 1 receives the packet and delivers it up to the STP component.

4.  Based on STP details, the STP component on Bridge 1 then decides to send an STP packet on the
1394 cable toward Device 1. The packet that appears on the 1394 cable looks the same as in the
preceding diagram, but the STP message is a new STP message, and the Bridge Identifier used by
STP is based on the random EUI-48 generated for the 1394 cable toward Device 1. This packet is
sent on the 1394 broadcast channel.

5.  Device 1 receives the STP packet via IPo1394. Because Device 1 is not a bridge, and is not

running STP, there is no STP component to deliver the packet up to, and the packet is ignored.

The following figure shows the sequence of packets exchanged in this example.

5  Security

The following sections specify security considerations for implementers of the IPv4 Over IEEE 1394
Protocol Extensions.

5.1  Security Considerations for Implementers

The basic IPv4 over IEEE 1394 protocol (IPo1394) has no security mechanism. This document does
not add any security to IPo1394. The protocol extension described in this document does not
introduce new security risks nor does it provide any security mechanisms.

5.2  Index of Security Parameters

None.

6  Appendix A: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental
software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

  Windows XP operating system

  Windows Server 2003 operating system

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base
(KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior
also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the
product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed
using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the
SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the
product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.4: For more information about the bridge component and its use of STP, see the
Windows XP product documentation in [WindowsBridge1] and the Windows Server TechCenter
documentation in [WindowsBridge2].

<2> Section 1.4: The Microsoft Windows implementation of IPo1394 uses a 1-byte pseudo-random
number for the 'client identifier' option field used in DHCP messages, as specified in [RFC2855] section
3.

<3> Section 1.6: The IPo1394 protocol, as specified in [RFC2734] and this document, is implemented
in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

<4> Section 3.1.1: On a Windows implementation of 1394 ARP (as specified in [RFC2734] section 5),
a table of outstanding ARP requests is used. Each entry in the table contains an IP address, a
retransmission count, a retransmission timer, and an expiration timer, as specified in section 3.1.2.

There is also a cache of previously resolved ARP requests, so that transmission of subsequent IPv4
datagrams does not require additional ARP requests to be sent. Each entry in the ARP cache contains
an IP address, unique_ID, unicast_FIFO_hi, and unicast_FIFO_lo, as specified in [RFC2734] section 5.

<5> Section 3.1.2: [RFC2734] does not explicitly mention any timers. However, to implement 1394
ARP (as specified in [RFC2734] section 5) Windows uses two timers.

  A 60-second retransmission timer per entry in the outstanding ARP request table.

  A 4-minute expiration timer per entry in the ARP cache.

<6> Section 3.1.3: The Windows implementation of IPo1394 uses a pseudo-random EUI-48 value
with the Locally Administered bit set in the EUI-48 that is given to and used by STP (as specified in
[IEEE802.1D] section 9) to generate the bridge ID.

<7> Section 3.1.3: At initialization time, when Windows 1394 ARP first acquires an address, it
performs duplicate address detection by sending a gratuitous ARP for its own address (as is common
practice on Ethernet). If another node responds to this request, the address is not used.

<8> Section 3.1.4.1: [RFC2734] section 7 specifies multiple ways of transmitting IPv4 unicast
datagrams. The Windows implementation of IPo1394 sends unicast IPv4 datagrams by using
transaction code 0x01 (asynchronous block write packet), as specified in [RFC2734] section 7.

<9> Section 3.1.4.2: The Windows implementation of IPo1394 uses "IP broadcast" for the multicast
transmit. Specifically, any higher-layer initiated multicast traffic is transmitted by IPo1394 on the
BROADCAST_CHANNEL, as specified in [RFC2734] section 8.

Release: June 1, 2017

<10> Section 3.1.5.2: The Windows implementation of IPo1394 implements the "multicast receive" as
specified in relation to the Multicast Channel Allocation Protocol (MCAP), as specified in [RFC2734]
section 9.3.

<11> Section 3.1.6: In Windows implementations when a retransmission timer expires for an entry in
the outstanding ARP request table, IPo1394 first checks whether an ARP cache entry already exists for
the associated IP address.





If no ARP cache entry exists: IPo1394 checks whether the retransmission count for the entry in
the retransmission table is less than 4. If it is less than 4, the retransmission count field is
incremented and a new ARP request packet is sent. If it is not less than 4, the entry in the
retransmission table is deleted.

 If an ARP cache entry exists: The ARP cache entry is deleted, and the entry in the retransmission
table is also deleted.

The ARP cache entry expiration timer and the events that it triggers are used when a device hardware
address is already resolved from a given IP address. The goal is to confirm that the given IP address
still resolves to the same device hardware address after four minutes of successful device hardware
address resolution. The events described below are used to achieve this goal.

 When an ARP cache entry expiration timer expires, IPo1394 transmits an ARP request packet in an
attempt to refresh the hardware address field for that ARP cache entry, adds an entry to the
outstanding ARP request table, and starts the retransmission timer.

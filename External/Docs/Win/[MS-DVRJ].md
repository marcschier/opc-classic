1  Introduction

The Device Registration Join Protocol provides a lightweight mechanism for registering personal or
corporate-owned devices with a workplace.

Whereas the discovery of information needed to register devices is obtained by use of the Device
Registration Discovery Protocol [MS-DVRD], the Device Registration Join Protocol, defined in this
specification, makes use of that information to register a device in the device registration service.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

1.1  Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

access control list (ACL): A list of access control entries (ACEs) that collectively describe the

security rules for authorizing access to some resource; for example, an object or set of objects.

Active Directory: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses

LDAP as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of
objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related
credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE]. Active Directory is either deployed as Active
Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS),
which are both described in [MS-ADOD]: Active Directory Protocols Overview.

Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF): A modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF),

commonly used by Internet specifications. ABNF notation balances compactness and simplicity
with reasonable representational power. ABNF differs from standard BNF in its definitions and
uses of naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. For more
information, see [RFC5234].

base64 encoding: A binary-to-text encoding scheme whereby an arbitrary sequence of bytes is

converted to a sequence of printable ASCII characters, as described in [RFC4648].

certificate: When referring to X.509v3 certificates, that information consists of a public key, a

distinguished name (DN) of some entity assumed to have control over the private key
corresponding to the public key in the certificate, and some number of other attributes and
extensions assumed to relate to the entity thus referenced. Other forms of certificates can bind
other pieces of information.

certification authority (CA): A third party that issues public key certificates. Certificates serve to
bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether
to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For
more information, see [RFC3280].

claim: A statement that one subject makes about itself or another subject. For example, the

statement can be about a name, identity, key, group, privilege, or capability. Claims have a
provider that issues them, and they are given one or more values. They are also defined by a
claim value type and, possibly, associated metadata.

container: An object in the directory that can serve as the parent for other objects. In the
absence of schema constraints, all objects would be containers. The schema allows only
objects of specific classes to be containers.

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): A high-precision atomic time standard that approximately
tracks Universal Time (UT). It is the basis for legal, civil time all over the Earth. Time zones
around the world are expressed as positive and negative offsets from UTC. In this role, it is also

5 / 30

referred to as Zulu time (Z) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In these specifications, all
references to UTC refer to the time at UTC-0 (or GMT).

device registration service: A service that allows registration of computing devices on a

corporate network. These devices might not be controlled by the administrator of the network.

directory: The database that stores information about objects such as users, groups, computers,

printers, and the directory service that makes this information available to users and
applications.

distinguished name (DN): A name that uniquely identifies an object by using the relative

distinguished name (RDN) for the object, and the names of container objects and domains that
contain the object. The distinguished name (DN) identifies the object and its location in a tree.

globally unique identifier (GUID): A term used interchangeably with universally unique

identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of
these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value.
Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in
[RFC4122] or [C706] have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique
identifier (UUID).

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): An extension of HTTP that securely encrypts and

decrypts web page requests. In some older protocols, "Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure
Sockets Layer" is still used (Secure Sockets Layer has been deprecated). For more information,
see [SSL3] and [RFC5246].

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON): A text-based, data interchange format that is used to

transmit structured data, typically in Asynchronous JavaScript + XML (AJAX) web applications,
as described in [RFC7159]. The JSON format is based on the structure of ECMAScript (Jscript,
JavaScript) objects.

JSON Web Token (JWT): A string representing a set of claims as a JSON object that is encoded

in a JWS or JWE, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message
Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted. For more information, see [RFC7519].

object: A set of attributes, each with its associated values. For more information on objects, see

[MS-ADTS] section 1 or [MS-DRSR] section 1.

object identifier (OID): In the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), a sequence of

numbers in a format described by [RFC1778]. In many LDAP directory implementations, an OID
is the standard internal representation of an attribute. In the directory model used in this
specification, the more familiar ldapDisplayName represents an attribute.

private key: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The private key is kept secret
and is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the corresponding public key. For an
introduction to this concept, see [CRYPTO] section 1.8 and [IEEE1363] section 3.1.

public key algorithm: An asymmetric cipher that uses two cryptographic keys: one for

encryption, the public key, and the other for decryption, the private key. In signature and
verification, the roles are reversed: public key is used for verification, and private key is used for
signature generation. Examples of public key algorithms are described in various standards,
including Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
(ECDSA) in FIPS 186-2 ([FIPS186]), RSA in PKCS#1 ([RFC8017]), the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) also published an introduction to public key technology in
SP800-32 ([SP800-32] section 5.6).

Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS): A group of Public Key Cryptography Standards

published by RSA Laboratories.

Representational State Transfer (REST): A class of web services that is used to transfer

domain-specific data by using HTTP, without additional messaging layers or session tracking,
and returns textual data, such as XML.

Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA): A system for public key cryptography. RSA is specified in

[RFC8017].

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): A security protocol that supports confidentiality and integrity of

messages in client and server applications that communicate over open networks. SSL supports
server and, optionally, client authentication using X.509 certificates [X509] and [RFC5280].
SSL is superseded by Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS version 1.0 is based on SSL
version 3.0 [SSL3].

security identifier (SID): An identifier for security principals that is used to identify an account
or a group. Conceptually, the SID is composed of an account authority portion (typically a
domain) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority, termed
the relative identifier (RID). The SID format is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2; a string
representation of SIDs is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD] section 1.1.1.2.

SHA1 hash: A hashing algorithm defined in [FIPS180] that was developed by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA).

SHA-256: An algorithm that generates a 256-bit hash value from an arbitrary amount of input

data.

thumbprint: A hash value computed over a datum.

Transport Layer Security (TLS): A security protocol that supports confidentiality and integrity of
messages in client and server applications communicating over open networks. TLS supports
server and, optionally, client authentication by using X.509 certificates (as specified in [X509]).
TLS is standardized in the IETF TLS working group.

X.509: An ITU-T standard for public key infrastructure subsequently adapted by the IETF, as

specified in [RFC3280].

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

Protocol.

1.4  Relationship to Other Protocols

The following figure illustrates the relationship of this protocol to other protocols.

Figure 1: Protocols related to the Device Registration Join Protocol

1.5  Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Device Registration Join Protocol issues X.509v3 certificates that have a corresponding
relationship with a device object represented in a directory server.  A server implementation of the
protocol requires the functionality of a certificate authority and a directory server.

This protocol requires that the following state changes be made to Active Directory.

1.  Create an instance of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service-Container class ([MS-ADSC] section

2.139) in the directory.

2.  Create an instance of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service class ([MS-ADSC] section 2.138) as

a child of the container object created in the previous step with the following attributes:

1.  Set the ms-DS-Registration-Quota attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.443) of the ms-DS-Device-

Registration-Service object to 10.

2.  Set the ms-DS-Maximum-Registration-Inactivity-Period attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.385)

of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service object to 90.

3.  Set the ms-DS-Is-Enabled attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.343) of the ms-DS-Device-

Registration-Service object to true.

4.  Set the ms-DS-Device-Location attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.305) of the ms-DS-Device-
Registration-Service object to a distinguished name (DN) of a container location in the
directory. The container is of class ms-DS-Device-Container ([MS-ADSC] section 2.137).

3.  Generate a certificate signing certificate. The certificate and private key are stored in the ms-DS-
Issuer-Certificates attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.351) of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service
object. For details, see section 2.3.1.

The public portion of the certificate is stored in the ms-DS-Issuer-Public-Certificates attribute
([MS-ADA2] section 2.352) of the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service object. For details, see
section 2.3.2.

4.  Set the following directory access control list (ACL) entries:

1.  Grant the server read access to the ms-DS-Device-Registration-Service object.

2.  Grant the server read/write access to ms-DS-Device objects ([MS-ADSC] section 2.136).

1.6  Applicability Statement

The Device Registration Join Protocol is applicable only for requests for device registration.

1.7  Versioning and Capability Negotiation

None.

1.8  Vendor-Extensible Fields

The Device Registration Join Protocol does not include any vendor-extensible fields.

1.9  Standards Assignments

2.3.1  ms-DS-Issuer-Certificates

The ms-DS-Issuer-Certificates attribute is a multi-valued OCTET_STRING attribute (see [MS-ADTS]
section 3.1.1.2.2.2, the String(Octet) syntax). Each value of the attribute is stored as a binary blob
containing the following formatted data:

"[time]:[binary value of an X.509 certificate]"

where [time] is the timestamp formatted as an integer representing the number of 100-nanosecond
intervals that have elapsed since 12:00:00 midnight, January 1, 0001, UTC, and [binary value of an
X.509 certificate] is the contents of an X.509 certificate [RFC5280] stored as an encrypted binary
blob.

2.3.2  ms-DS-Issuer-Public-Certificates

The ms-DS-Issuer-Public-Certificates attribute is a multi-valued OCTET_STRING attribute. Each value
of the attribute is stored as a binary blob containing an X.509 certificate [RFC5280].

2.3.3  Alt-Security-Identities

The Alt-Security-Identities attribute ([MS-ADA1] section 2.61) is a multi-valued UNICODE_STRING
attribute (see [MS-ADTS] section 3.1.1.2.2.2, the String(Unicode) syntax). The value is formatted as
follows:

"X509:<SHA1-TP-PUBKEY>[thumbprint]+[publickeyhash]"

where [thumbprint] is the SHA1 hash of a certificate and [publickeyhash] is the base64-encoded
SHA-256 ([NIST.FIPS.180-4]) of the X.509 certificate public key [RFC5280].

2.3.4  ms-DS-Key-Credential-Link

The ms-DS-Key-Credential-Link attribute ([MS-ADA2] section 2.358) is a DN-Binary attribute (see
[MS-ADTS] section 3.1.1.2.2.2, the Object(DN-Binary) syntax). The value is formatted as follows:

3.1.5.1.2.1  Request Body

The request body MUST be empty.

3.1.5.1.2.2  Response Body

If the DRS server successfully removes the device object from the directory, an HTTP 200 status code
("OK") is returned. If the DRS server does NOT respond to the HTTP DELETE request with the HTTP
status code set to 200, the body of the HTTP response MUST contain an ErrorDetails object (section
2.2.3.1) that provides the client with additional, implementation-specific information about the error.
Otherwise, the response body MUST be empty.

3.1.5.1.2.3  Processing Details

The HTTP DELETE request is processed as follows.

1.  Client authentication is established between the client and the DRS server using TLS. If

authentication is NOT established, the server MUST respond to the HTTP DELETE with an HTTP
response that has the HTTP status code set to 401 ("Unauthorized").

2.  The DRS server looks up the device object in the directory using the Alt-Security-Identities

attribute of the device, where the [thumbprint]+[publickeyhash] portions of the attribute are
derived from the X.509 certificate that was provided by the client in step 1. See section 2.3.3 for
details on the format of the Alt-Security-Identities attribute. If a device object is NOT found in the
directory, the DRS server responds with an HTTP response that has the HTTP status code set to
401 ("Unauthorized").

3.  The DRS server removes the device object from the directory. If the DRS server fails to remove

the device object from the directory, the DRS server responds with an HTTP response that has the
HTTP status code set to 400 ("Bad Request").

5  Security

5.1  Security Considerations for Implementers

The Device Registration Join Protocol uses HTTPS as a transport. Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
server certificate verification ensures that the client is communicating with the real server and closes
any possible man-in-the-middle attacks.

The input message uses an JSON Web Token for both authentication and authorization. The server
must validate that the security token is signed by a trusted identity provider, is within the token
validity period, and that the target audience of the token is the server.

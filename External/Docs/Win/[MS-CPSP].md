1  Introduction

The Connection Point Services: Phonebook Data Structure specifies a format for documenting point of
presence (POP) entry information and a logical grouping of POPs based on their geographic location or
area. Connection Point Services (CPS) enables the automatic distribution and updating of custom
phone books. These phone book files contain one or more POP entries, with each POP supplying a
telephone number that provides dial-up access to an Internet access point. The companion region file
contains geographic location information for each POP entry.

Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this
specification are informative.

1.1  Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

access control list (ACL): A list of access control entries (ACEs) that collectively describe the

security rules for authorizing access to some resource; for example, an object or set of objects.

ASCII: The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is an 8-bit character-
encoding scheme based on the English alphabet. ASCII codes represent text in computers,
communications equipment, and other devices that work with text. ASCII refers to a single 8-bit
ASCII character or an array of 8-bit ASCII characters with the high bit of each character set to
zero.

client: A computer on which the remote procedure call (RPC) client is executing.

Connection Point Services (CPS) phonebook file: A file that contains POP entries.

dial-up networking (DUN) client: The software on a user's client machine that makes the dial-

up connection by using a modem or an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) line.

point of presence (POP): The geographic location for which the Internet service provider (ISP) or

the administrator of a corporate network provides a local access number.

POP entry: A CPS phonebook file entry that contains a local access number for a specific region

in a country. A POP entry also contains other parameters that are useful for end users,
enterprise administrators, and Internet service providers (ISPs).

POP entry field: A field in the POP entry.

region: A geographic location or area information. Region names are stored in a region file.

region file: An ASCII text file that is used to store the region names.

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

1.2  References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the
most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents
in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not
match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the Errata.

1.3  Overview

Users often use a dial-up connection, such as a modem or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN),
to access resources on the Internet or on a corporate network. The Internet service providers (ISPs)
that provide Internet access or the administrators of a corporate network can provide several local
access numbers in the geographic areas where they provide service so that users need not pay long-
distance charges. These geographic locations with their local access numbers are called points of
presence (POPs).

The POPs of an ISP or corporate network can change over time and, when they change, the most
current POP information has to be published to users in a reliable and cost-effective manner. The
Connection Point Services (CPS) phonebook file data structure specifies a format for
documenting POP entry information.

Because there can be multiple POP entries in a geographic location or area, and to supply multiple
connection options to users, the CPS phonebook file provides a logical grouping of POPs information
based on the geographic location or area. For example, an ISDN number that provides higher
bandwidth for users who have an ISDN connection may be included. In this document, geographic
locations or areas are called regions. Each POP has the information about the region it serves. The
list of regions is stored in a separate file known as a region file.

The dial-up networking (DUN) client allows the user to select the POP entry of their choice and
connect to the network. For example, users can select one local POP entry when they are in India and
use another local POP entry if they visit the United States.

1.4  Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures

Users can use any suitable transfer mechanism—including copying to a USB flash drive or using a
protocol such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)—to retrieve and
store, or update, the Connection Point Services (CPS) phonebook file and region file on their
computers.<1>

1.5  Applicability Statement

A dial-up networking (DUN) client can use the CPS phonebook file and region file to connect to
the Internet or to a corporate network.

2  Structures

2.1  CPS Phonebook File

The CPS phonebook file is stored as an ASCII text file. It contains zero or more POP entries that
are separated by a line feed/carriage return.

If there are zero POP entries in the phonebook file, then processing of the phonebook file SHOULD
gracefully stop without attempting to read the POP entries.

Each POP entry consists of a sequence of POP entry fields that are separated by a comma ",". Each
POP entry MUST have 10 or 11 commas (the eleventh comma is optional). If the number of commas
in a POP entry is less than 10, all subsequent POP entries MUST be ignored. If the number of commas
in a POP entry is more than 11, all the POP entries in the CPS phonebook file MUST be ignored.

A POP entry contains the following fields in the following order. All the entries are represented as
string values in the ASCII CPS phonebook file:

POP Index: This field MUST be an unsigned integer value that is represented as an ASCII string. The
POP Index field is optional. If the POP Index contains characters other than numbers (0-9), this
POP entry and all the subsequent POP entries MUST be ignored.

Country Code: This field MUST be an unsigned integer value that is represented as an ASCII string,
as specified in [E164]. This field is the code for the country to which the user wants to make a
dial-up connection. For example, the country code would be "1" for United States or "91" for India.
This field MUST be present. This POP entry MUST be ignored if the country code is not present. All
POP entries in the CPS phonebook file MUST be ignored if the Country Code has a nonnumeric
character.

Region Id: An index of the region name in the region file. This field MUST be an unsigned integer
value that is represented as an ASCII string. This field is optional. The index starts with 1 (1-
based), which corresponds to the first region name. Index 2 corresponds to the second region
name. A value of zero identifies all regions. If the Region Id fails to identify a region, because the
Region Id is beyond the number of regions in the file, the POP entry MUST still be processed but
without any region information. All POP entries in the CPS phonebook file MUST be ignored if the
Region Id has a nonnumeric character.

POP Name: The name of the POP entry. All ASCII characters are allowed in the POP Name except the
comma ",". This field is optional and, if present, MUST have a maximum length of 31 characters. If
the length of the POP Name exceeds 31 characters, the first 31 characters MUST be read as the
POP Name and the remaining characters of the POP Name MUST be treated as the next field.
However, in this case, all the subsequent POP entries MUST be ignored.

Area Code: This field denotes the telephonic area code within the designated country code for the

access number. This field MUST be an unsigned integer value that is represented as an ASCII
string. This field is optional and if present, MUST have a maximum length of 11 characters and
MUST contain zero or more numbers (0-9). If the length exceeds 11 characters, the first 11
characters MUST be read as the Area Code and the remaining characters MUST be treated as the
next field. However, in this case, all the subsequent POP entries MUST be ignored. If the Area
Code contains non-numeric characters, it MUST be ignored.

Access Number: This field denotes the phone number that is used to dial the connection. This field
MUST be present and MUST include one or more numbers (0-9), and zero or more number signs
"#", asterisks "*", hyphens "-", or spaces " ". If this field is not present, the CPS phonebook file is
still parsed, but actual dialing of the dial-up connection will fail. This field MUST have a maximum
length of 41 characters. If the length exceeds 41 characters, the first 41 characters MUST be read
as the Access Number and the remaining characters MUST be treated as the next field. However,
in this case, all the subsequent POP entries MUST be ignored. If the Access Number field contains

Release: April 23, 2024

any characters outside of the allowed list stated above, it MUST still be read, but dialing of the
number might fail.

Minimum Analog Speed: This field denotes the minimum analog speed, in kilobits per second, of the
modem or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) line. This field is optional and, if present,
MUST be an unsigned integer value that is represented as an ASCII string. All the POP entries in
the CPS phonebook file MUST be ignored if the Minimum Analog Speed has a nonnumeric
character.

Maximum Analog Speed: This field denotes the maximum analog speed, in kilobits per second, of

the modem or ISDN line. This field is optional and, if present, MUST be an unsigned integer value
that is represented as an ASCII string. All the POP entries in the CPS phonebook file MUST be
ignored if the Maximum Analog Speed has a nonnumeric character.

Reserved Flag: This optional field is reserved. If present, this field MUST be zero or a positive

number that is represented as an ASCII string. If the Reserved Flag is a negative number or has a
nonnumeric character, all the POP entries in the CPS phonebook file MUST be ignored.

POP Flag: This field is a set of flags that are used to specify the properties of the POP entry. If the
POP Flag is a negative number or has a nonnumeric character, all the POP entries in the CPS
phonebook file MUST be ignored. This field is optional and, if not present, MUST default to zero.

The POP Flag is the decimal representation of the bit sequence that consists of the following flags:

  Sign on: This POP Flag denotes that the user MUST authenticate each time the user dials the

connection. This POP Flag MUST be zero. Otherwise, this POP entry MUST be ignored.

  Sign up: This POP Flag denotes that the POP allows the user to sign up for an account with

the service provider.

  Modem: This POP Flag denotes that the user can make the connection by using a modem.



ISDN: This POP Flag denotes that the user can dial the connection by using an ISDN line.

  Custom 1: This reserved flag SHOULD be zero and MUST be ignored by the DUN client for

any value of this flag.

  Multicast: This POP Flag denotes that POP supports transport of IP multicast datagrams over

the dial-up connection.

  Surcharge: This POP Flag denotes that the service provider can charge the user a surcharge

for connecting to this POP.

  Custom 2: This reserved flag MUST be zero and ignored on receipt.

The bit representation of the POP Flag is as follows.

Dialup Networking Name: The display name of the POP entry that can be used by the dial-up

networking client to correlate any additional information with that POP entry. This optional field
has a maximum length of 50 characters. All ASCII characters MUST be allowed in the Dialup
Networking Name.

If the length exceeds 50 characters, the first 50 characters MUST be read as the Dialup
Networking Name and the remaining characters MUST be ignored.

The Dialup Networking Name is terminated by a line feed/carriage return "\LF\CR\" or a comma
",".

2.2  Region File

The region file is an ASCII text file that is used to store the region names. It contains one or more
region names that are separated by line feed/carriage return "\LF\CR\" or comma ",". If the region file
contains zero region names, no region information will be read and all POP entries in the
phonebook file will be without region information.

The first line in the file MUST be an integer that is represented as an ASCII string and that denotes the
number of region names in the region file. If the first line in the file contains non-numeric characters,
all POP entries in the phonebook will be ignored. If this value is less than the number of region names,
then the region names at the index greater than this value MUST be ignored. If the value is greater
than the number of region names, then all region names MUST be read.

All the following lines in the file MUST contain the region name, one region per line.

The maximum length of a region name MUST be 31 characters. All ASCII characters MUST be allowed
in the region name.

If the length exceeds 31 characters, the first 31 characters MUST be read as the region name and the
remaining characters MUST be ignored.

3  Structure Examples

Example of a POP entry:

The following is an example of a POP entry that is stored in the CPS phonebook file.

 23,1,2,Redmond,999,5550134,9600,56000,0,96,\LF\CR

In the previous example, the POP entry fields are interpreted as follows.

 POP Index = 23
 Country Code = 1
 Region Id = 2
 POP Name = Redmond
 Area Code = 999
 Access Number = 5550134
 Minimum Analog Speed = 9600
 Maximum Analog Speed = 56000
 Reserved Flag = 0
 POP Flag = 96 (Selected Options: Sign On, Modem, ISDN, Surcharge)
 Dialup Networking Name = ""

Another example of a POP entry in a CPS phonebook file (with all the optional fields omitted) follows.

 ,91,,,,55500123,,,,,,\LF\CR

In the previous example, the POP entry fields are interpreted as follows.

 POP Index = 0
 Country Code = 91
 Region Id = 0
 POP Name = ""
 Area Code = ""
 Access Number = 55500123
 Minimum Analog Speed = 0
 Maximum Analog Speed = 0
 Reserved Flag = 0
 POP Flag = 0
 Dialup Networking Name = ""

Example of a region file.

 2\LF\CR
 Seattle\LF\CR
 Hyderabad\LF\CR

The "2" in the first line denotes the number of region entries in the region file. The entries that follow
this line are the region names "Seattle" and "Hyderabad".

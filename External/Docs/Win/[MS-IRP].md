## 1 Introduction

The Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol is a remote procedure call (RPC)–
based client/server protocol that is used for managing Internet protocol servers such as those
hosted by Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). Managed servers can include servers for
HTTP, FTP, SMTP, or other Internet protocols. For more information on IIS, see [MSDN-IIS].

The universally unique identifier (UUID) for the IIS Inetinfo Remote Protocol interface is
{82ad4280-036b-11cf-972c-00aa006887b0}.

The version for this interface is 2.0.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

### 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

authentication level: A numeric value indicating the level of authentication or message protection

that remote procedure call (RPC) will apply to a specific message exchange. For more
information, see [C706] section 13.1.2.1 and [MS-RPCE].

Authentication Service (AS): A service that issues ticket granting tickets (TGTs), which are used
for authenticating principals within the realm or domain served by the Authentication Service.

Binary Gateway Interface (BGI): An extension API for HTTP servers that is analogous to the

Common Gateway Interface (CGI) but relies on direct method calls and parameter passing. In
the IIS HTTP server, BGI is equivalent to the Internet Server API (ISAPI).

binary large object (BLOB): A discrete packet of data that is stored in a database and is treated

as a sequence of uninterpreted bytes.

endpoint: (1) A client that is on a network and is requesting access to a network access server

(NAS).

(2) A network-specific address of a remote procedure call (RPC) server process for remote
procedure calls. The actual name and type of the endpoint depends on the RPC protocol
sequence that is being used. For example, for RPC over TCP (RPC Protocol Sequence
ncacn_ip_tcp), an endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For RPC over Server Message Block (RPC
Protocol Sequence ncacn_np), an endpoint might be the name of a named pipe. For more
information, see [C706].

Interface Definition Language (IDL): The International Standards Organization (ISO) standard

language for specifying the interface for remote procedure calls. For more information, see
[C706] section 4.

Internet Information Services (IIS): The services provided in Windows implementation that
support web server functionality. IIS consists of a collection of standard Internet protocol
servers such as HTTP and FTP in addition to common infrastructures that are used by other
Microsoft Internet protocol servers such as SMTP, NNTP, and so on. IIS has been part of the
Windows operating system in some versions and a separate install package in others. IIS
version 5.0 shipped as part of Windows 2000 operating system, IIS version 5.1 as part of
Windows XP operating system, IIS version 6.0 as part of Windows Server 2003 operating
system, and IIS version 7.0 as part of Windows Vista operating system and Windows Server
2008 operating system.

Internet protocol server: A software program that implements the server host of a standard

Internet protocol such as HTTP or FTP.

Internet protocol server instance (server instance): A configuration collection for an

Internet protocol server that will establish its own network protocol endpoint. A single
Internet protocol server can configure multiple server instances that would each appear to
clients as an independent host site.

network byte order: The order in which the bytes of a multiple-byte number are transmitted on a

network, most significant byte first (in big-endian storage). This does not always match the
order in which numbers are normally stored in memory for a particular processor.

opnum: An operation number or numeric identifier that is used to identify a specific remote

procedure call (RPC) method or a method in an interface. For more information, see [C706]
section 12.5.2.12 or [MS-RPCE].

remote procedure call (RPC): A communication protocol used primarily between client and

server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime
environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set
of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the
single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message).  For more information, see [C706].

RPC client: A computer on the network that sends messages using remote procedure call (RPC) as

its transport, waits for responses, and is the initiator in an RPC exchange.

RPC protocol sequence: A character string that represents a valid combination of a remote

procedure call (RPC) protocol, a network layer protocol, and a transport layer protocol, as
described in [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

Server Message Block (SMB): A protocol that is used to request file and print services from
server systems over a network. The SMB protocol extends the CIFS protocol with additional
security, file, and disk management support. For more information, see [CIFS] and [MS-SMB].

stub: Used as specified in [C706] section 2.1.2.2. A stub that is used on the client is called a

"client stub", and a stub that is used on the server is called a "server stub".

universally unique identifier (UUID): A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple

purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very
persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager
entry-point vectors, and RPC objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also
known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in the
Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does not
imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the use of
this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [RFC4122] or [C706] has to
be used for generating the UUID.

virtual root: A configured mapping within an Internet protocol server instance between an

instance URI and a file system directory. For example, a virtual root could map the URI
"/somepath" to the file system directory "d:\webcontent". For more information about the
syntax of a URI, see [RFC3986].

well-known endpoint: A preassigned, network-specific, stable address for a particular

client/server instance. For more information, see [C706].

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

### 1.3 Overview

The Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol provides functions that allow remote
administration and statistics gathering from an Internet protocol server such as a server
implementing the HTTP or FTP protocol. The protocol provides methods for gathering statistical data
on users, sites, requests, and performance. For more information about HTTP and securing HTTP
connections, see [RFC2068] and [RFC2818].

The server does not maintain client state information. Although some client call sequences might be
logically related, the protocol operation is stateless.

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol uses RPC as its protocol transport,
as specified in [MS-RPCE].

### 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

This protocol requires that the client and server be able to communicate by means of an RPC
connection, as specified in section 2.1.

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol is appropriate for managing an
Internet protocol server or a collection of such servers on a remote computer.

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

The Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol has been modified between versions
of IIS in ways that make interoperability between different server implementations difficult.
Modifications to the interface between IIS versions will be noted in section 2.2 or section 3.1.<1>

### 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses Win32 error codes. These values are taken from the Windows error number space
as specified in [MS-ERREF] section 2.2. Vendors SHOULD reuse those values with their indicated
meaning.  Choosing any other value runs the risk of a collision in the future.

### 1.9 Standards Assignments

The server interface MUST be identified by UUID "82ad4280-036b-11cf-972c-00aa006887b0", version
2.0.

The server MUST specify RPC over Server Message Block (SMB) as the RPC protocol sequence
to the RPC implementation (as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.1.1.2), using the RPC well-known
endpoint \PIPE\inetinfo.

The server MUST also specify RPC over TCP/IP as an RPC protocol sequence to the RPC
implementation, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.1.1.1.

The server SHOULD specify "NTLM" (0xA) as the RPC authentication service, as specified in [MS-
RPCE] section 3.<2>

#### 2.1.2 Client

The client SHOULD use RPC over SMB (ncacn_np) or RPC over TCP/IP (ncacn_ip_tcp) as the RPC
protocol sequence to communicate with the server. Using other protocol sequences MAY work
depending on the configuration and implementation of the server.

The client MAY use an authentication level of privacy to connect to the server and if the server does
not support this authentication level, it MAY fall back to connection. Authentication levels are specified
in [MS-RPCE].

### 2.2 Common Data Types

In addition to the RPC data types that are specified in [MS-RPCE], the sections that follow use the
definitions of DWORD, WCHAR, LPWSTR, LCID, LARGE_INTEGER, and BYTE, as specified in [MS-
DTYP].

For more information on the additional data types in the following sections, see [MSDN-MIDL].

#### 2.2.1 INET_INFO_IMPERSONATE_HANDLE

The INET_INFO_IMPERSONATE_HANDLE type defines a pointer to an array of WCHAR elements. The
client uses this pointer as a custom binding handle, which it converts to an explicit server binding
handle for a target server. On the client, the value MUST be sufficient to generate an appropriate
server binding handle. The value of this parameter MUST NOT be used on the server.

This type is declared as follows:

Mask:  A value that indicates the capabilities that can be enabled for the protocol servers in the

current implementation. The possible values for this member result from a bitwise OR operation of
zero or more of the following flags.

Note  The Mask value contains all the capabilities that the current version of the protocol server

implementation can support. The Flag value indicates the features that the current running
server instance does support.The server sets the mask value to a bitwise OR of all the flags it
knows about. The server then sets the flags to the bitwise OR of the features supported for the
current platform, a subset of those set in the mask field. A given version of the software reports
the same mask values, but might support different flags values depending on the operating
system type.

## 3 Protocol Details

The following sections specify details of the Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote
Protocol, including abstract data models, interface method syntax, and message processing rules.

The client side of this protocol is simply a pass-through. That is, no additional timers or other state is
required on the client side of this protocol. Calls made by the higher-layer protocol or application are
passed directly to the transport, and the results returned by the transport are passed directly back to
the higher-layer protocol or application.

### 3.1 Inetinfo Server Details

The IIS Inetinfo Remote Protocol server handles client requests for any of the messages that are
specified in section 2. For each of those messages, the behavior of the server is specified in section
3.1.4.

An implementation MAY implement only a subset of the methods specified in the inetinfo interface. Or
a particular Internet protocol server might only be able to support a subset of methods specified in
the interface. For methods that are not implemented, the server SHOULD return
ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED (0x00000032).

#### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

The Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol provides runtime status and
statistical data and manages runtime configuration for the Internet protocol server. The Internet
protocol server MUST provide a mechanism to collect runtime data and expose it through the Internet
Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol server. Some methods operate on configuration
data that SHOULD be persisted beyond the lifetime of an Internet protocol server process.

#### 3.1.2 Timers

None.

#### 3.1.3 Initialization

The Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol server MUST be initialized by
registering the RPC interface and listening on the RPC well-known endpoint, as specified in section
2.1. The server MUST then wait for Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol
clients to establish a connection.

#### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

The Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol is invoked explicitly by an
application.

#### 3.1.5 Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The remainder of this section describes the server behavior for the RPC methods on the inetinfo
interface that makes up the IIS Inetinfo Remote Protocol. IIS Inetinfo Remote Protocol clients can
invoke the RPC methods that are specified in this section in any order after an Internet Information
Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol session is established with the server. The outcome of the
calls depends on the parameters that are passed to each of those calls and not on a particular call
sequence or state maintained across method invocations.

## 4 Protocol Examples

This section describes a sequence of operations to illustrate the function of the Internet Information
Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol.

1.  The client receives a request from an application to retrieve the virtual root directory of the FTP

server on the server host.

2.  The client sends an R_InetInfoGetAdminInformation message to the server by first invoking

the R_InetInfoGetAdminInformation RPC client Stub method with the following parameters:







pszServer = "server host name"

dwServerMask = 0x00000001 (INET_FTP_SVC_ID)

ppConfig = address of LPINET_INFO_CONFIG_INFO

3.  The client establishes a connection to the remote server by building an explicit server binding

handle as specified in section 2.2.1.

4.  When the server receives this request from the client, it allocates and initializes the

INET_INFO_CONFIG_INFO structure and populates it with data from the FTP server. The server
then returns 0 (ERROR_SUCCESS) and the pointer to the INET_INFO_CONFIG_INFO structure
in the ppConfig parameter of the response.

5.  The client retrieves the virtual root data from the returned INET_INFO_CONFIG_INFO

structure, returns it to the application, and frees the data allocated by the RPC client Stub.

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base
(KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior
also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the
product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed
using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the
SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the
product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.7: The Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol is implemented in
Windows by Internet Information Services (IIS). The RPC interface and data types have been
modified between versions of IIS (without changing the version number) in ways that make complete
interoperability between versions difficult if not impossible.

56 / 63

[MS-IRP] - v20240423
Internet Information Services (IIS) Inetinfo Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


The version described as the standard in this document is IIS version 5.0 that shipped with Windows
2000 Professional, and Windows 2000 Server.

<2> Section 2.1.1: When the Windows implementation specifies "ncacn_np" as the RPC protocol, a
security descriptor is set on the endpoint (2) by using the RPC API RpcServerUseProtseqEpW(). The
security descriptor grants access to members of the administrators group. The RPC runtime will then
validate the client's identity against this security descriptor.

<3> Section 2.2.3: Some members of the INET_INFO_CONFIG_INFO structure are not persisted
such as LangId and LocalId. These vary by version and by protocol.

<4> Section 2.2.3: The Windows implementation will return an empty string when retrieving
szAnonPassword, even if the configuration value is set.

<5> Section 2.2.8: The Windows implementation will return an empty string when retrieving
AccountPassword, even if the configuration value is set.

<6> Section 2.2.15: The INETA_CACHE_STATISTICS structure has been modified twice in different
versions of IIS.

IIS version 3.0 of the structure is defined as follows:

 typedef struct _INETA_CACHE_STATISTICS
   {
    DWORD         CacheBytesTotal;
    DWORD         CacheBytesInUse;
    DWORD         CurrentOpenFileHandles;
    DWORD         CurrentDirLists;
    DWORD         CurrentObjects;
    DWORD         FlushesFromDirChanges;
    DWORD         CacheHits;
    DWORD         CacheMisses;
  } INETA_CACHE_STATISTICS * LPINETA_CACHE_STATISTICS;

CacheBytesTotal: The total size of the cache in bytes.

CacheBytesInUse: The number of bytes in the cache currently in use.

CurrentOpenFileHandles: The number of handles to currently open files stored in the cache.

CurrentDirLists: The number of current directory lists stored in the cache.

CurrentObjects: The number of current objects stored in the cache.

FlushesFromDirChanges: The number of flushes that have taken place as a result of directory

changes.

CacheHits: The number of hits to the cache.

CacheMisses: The number of misses to the cache.

IIS version 6.0 of the structure is defined as follows:

 typedef struct _INETA_CACHE_STATISTICS
  {
     DWORD FilesCached;
     DWORD TotalFilesCached;

[MS-IRP] - v20240423

     DWORD FileHits;
     DWORD FileMisses;
     DWORD FileFlushes;
     DWORDLONG CurrentFileCacheSize;
     DWORDLONG MaximumFileCacheSize;
     DWORD FlushedEntries;
     DWORD TotalFlushed;
     DWORD URICached;
     DWORD TotalURICached;
     DWORD URIHits;
     DWORD URIMisses;
     DWORD URIFlushes;
     DWORD TotalURIFlushed;
     DWORD BlobCached;
     DWORD TotalBlobCached;
     DWORD BlobHits;
     DWORD BlobMisses;
     DWORD BlobFlushes;
     DWORD TotalBlobFlushed;
  } INETA_CACHE_STATISTICS, *LPINETA_CACHE_STATISTICS;

CurrentFileCacheSize and MaximumFileCacheSize are the only fields changed from the IIS
version 5.0. Their data types have been changed from DWORD to DWORDLONG.

<7> Section 2.2.25: The Windows implementation can return error codes that have additional
semantic meaning because it relates to the protocol beyond that which is specified in [MS-ERREF]. The
following table summarizes these additional semantics.

Return value/code

Interpretation/condition

0x00000426

ERROR_SERVICE_NOT_ACTIVE

Used to indicate that the specified Internet protocol service is not recognized by
the implementation.

0x00000002

ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND

Used by methods that operate on an Internet protocol server instance to
indicate that the instance ID passed by the client is not recognized.

<8> Section 3.1.5: Opnums reserved for local use apply to Windows as follows.

Opnum  Description

16, 17

Only used locally by Windows, never remotely. These methods were added to the inetinfo interface in
Windows 2000 Server and deprecated in Windows Server 2003.

<9> Section 3.1.5.1:  The Windows implementation of R_InetInfoGetVersion does not return Major
Version = 5 and Minor Version = 1 for implementations of IIS released on Windows NT 4.0, Windows
2000 Professional, and Windows 2000 Server.

<10> Section 3.1.5.3: In IIS version 3.0, the R_InetInfoGetSites method is not implemented.
Instead, the following method is defined at opnum 2.

<11> Section 3.1.5.7: The Windows implementation of R_InetInfoQueryStatistics returns valid
statistical data only when the dwServerMask parameter is 0.

<12> Section 3.1.5.8: The Windows implementation of R_InetInfoClearStatistics does nothing and
returns ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED. If dwServerMask is greater than 0x00000004, the return code is
ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.

<13> Section 3.1.5.12: The Windows implementation of R_W3ClearStatistics2 does not reset all
statistics values in the W3_STATISTICS_1 structure. Values related to client network connections
and network bandwidth are not reset.

<14> Section 3.1.5.14: The Windows implementation of R_FtpClearStatistics2 does not reset all
statistics values in the FTP_STATISTICS_0 structure. Values related to client network connections
and network bandwidth are not reset.

<15> Section 3.1.5.15: The Windows implementation of R_IISEnumerateUsers returns
ERROR_SUCCESS (0x00000000) for the HTTP server when the method is not implemented.

<16> Section 3.1.5.16: The Windows implementation of R_IISDisconnectUser for the FTP server
will attempt to disconnect specific users in addition to all users, given appropriate values of dwIdUser.
The HTTP server will only attempt to disconnect all users if dwIdUser is 0 and will ignore other values
of this parameter and return ERROR_SUCCESS.

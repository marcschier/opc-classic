1  Introduction

This File System Management Overview describes the purpose and use of the protocols that are
required for remote administration and management of file servers in an organization.

The system administrator uses an administrative client to configure and query the state of file
services, such as Distributed File System (DFS) and File Replication Service (FRS). The administrator
can also use the administrative client to configure various policies that apply to the object store on a
file server, such as disk quotas to set limits on user disk space use, screening and filtering to restrict
the type of content that can be stored, and other policies. Users and applications access these services
through file clients. File client and file access protocols are described in the File Access Services
Protocol Overview ([MS-FASOD]).

1.1  Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

Active Directory: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which

uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of
objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related
credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE]. Active Directory is either deployed as Active
Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS),
which are both described in [MS-ADOD]: Active Directory Protocols Overview.

admin client: An instance of a client of the File Service administration protocols, as described in

[MS-DFSNM], [MS-DFSRH], [MS-FSRM], [MS-SRVS], and [MS-WKST].

classification rule: A FSRM object that defines a rule, which invokes a classification module on
the files in a set of directories to apply property definition instances to each of those files.

computer name: The DNS or NetBIOS name.

DFS service: A service on the file server that implements the server functionality of the

Namespace Referral protocol defined in [MS-DFSC] and Namespace Management protocol
defined in [MS-DFSNM].

DFS-R: A service that keeps DFS and SYSVOL folders in sync automatically. DFS-R is a state-
based, multimaster replication system that supports replication scheduling and bandwidth
throttling. This is a rewrite and new version of FRS. For more information, see [MS-FRS2].

directory quota: An FSRM object that is associated with a file system directory that limits the

amount of data, which the system or any user can store in a directory.

directory service (DS): A service that stores and organizes information about a computer

network's users and network shares, and that allows network administrators to manage users'
access to the shares. See also Active Directory.

Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM): The Microsoft Component Object Model (COM)
specification that defines how components communicate over networks, as specified in [MS-
DCOM].

Distributed File System (DFS): A file system that logically groups physical shared folders located
on different servers by transparently connecting them to one or more hierarchical namespaces.
DFS also provides fault-tolerance and load-sharing capabilities.

Distributed File System (DFS) link: A component in a DFS path that lies below the DFS root and
maps to one or more DFS link targets. Also interchangeably used to refer to a DFS path that
contains the DFS link.

[MS-FSMOD] - v20211026
File Services Management Protocols Overview

Release: October 26, 2021

Distributed File System (DFS) namespace: A virtual view of shares on different servers as

provided by DFS. Each file in the namespace has a logical name and a corresponding address
(path). A DFS namespace consists of a root and many links and targets. The namespace starts
with a root that maps to one or more root targets. Below the root are links that map to their
own targets.

Distributed File System (DFS) namespace, standalone: A DFS namespace that has

metadata stored locally on the host server. The path to access the root or a link starts with the
host server name. A stand-alone DFS root has only one root target. Stand-alone roots are not
fault-tolerant; when the root target is unavailable, the entire DFS namespace is inaccessible.
Stand-alone DFS roots can be made fault tolerant by creating them on clustered file servers.

domain: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management

infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller
(DC) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally
hosting the Active Directory service. The domain controller provides authentication of
members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared
among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS].

domain controller (DC): The service, running on a server, that implements Active Directory, or
the server hosting this service. The service hosts the data store for objects and interoperates
with other DCs to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across all DCs.
When Active Directory is operating as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), the DC
contains full NC replicas of the configuration naming context (config NC), schema naming
context (schema NC), and one of the domain NCs in its forest. If the AD DS DC is a global
catalog server (GC server), it contains partial NC replicas of the remaining domain NCs in its
forest. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5.2 and [MS-ADTS]. When
Active Directory is operating as Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS),
several AD LDS DCs can run on one server. When Active Directory is operating as AD DS, only
one AD DS DC can run on one server. However, several AD LDS DCs can coexist with one AD
DS DC on one server. The AD LDS DC contains full NC replicas of the config NC and the schema
NC in its forest. The domain controller is the server side of Authentication Protocol Domain
Support [MS-APDS].

file: An entity of data in the file system that a user can access and manage. A file has to have a
unique name in its directory. It consists of one or more streams of bytes that hold a set of
related data, plus a set of attributes also called properties that describe the file or the data
within the file. The creation time of a file is an example of a file attribute.

file group: An FSRM object that contains a logical collection of file name patterns, which are

identified by name that is used to define file screens and file screen exceptions. File group
definitions can also be used for generating report jobs that are based on the file type.

file management job: A scheduled task that applies a command to a set of files as determined by

a list of conditions and a list of namespaces.

File Replication Service (FRS): One of the services offered by a domain controller (DC),

which is advertised through the Domain Controller Location protocol. The service being offered
to clients is a replicated data storage volume that is associated with the default naming context
(NC). The running or paused state of the FRS on a DC is available through protocols
documented in [MS-ADTS] section 6.3.

file screen: An FSRM object that is associated with a file system directory that limits the types of
files that the system or any user can store in a directory. When a restricted file is detected, the
FSRM server can raise one or more FSRM notifications.

file server: The service or process on a server computer that implements the server-side file

access protocol components to enable remote file sharing for the file clients.

file system: A system that enables applications to store and retrieve files on storage devices.

Files are placed in a hierarchical structure. The file system specifies naming conventions for files
and the format for specifying the path to a file in the tree structure. Each file system consists of
one or more drivers and DLLs that define the data formats and features of the file system. File
systems can exist on the following storage devices: diskettes, hard disks, jukeboxes, removable
optical disks, and tape backup units.

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The primary access protocol for Active

Directory. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard protocol,
established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which allows users to query and
update information in a directory service (DS), as described in [MS-ADTS]. The Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol can be either version 2 [RFC1777] or version 3 [RFC3377].

named pipe: A named, one-way, or duplex pipe for communication between a pipe server and one

or more pipe clients.

server: A computer on which the remote procedure call (RPC) server is executing.

service: A process or agent that is available on the network, offering resources or services for

clients. Examples of services include file servers, web servers, and so on.

session: In Server Message Block (SMB), a persistent-state association between an SMB client and

SMB server. A session is tied to the lifetime of the underlying NetBIOS or TCP connection.

share: A resource offered by a Common Internet File System (CIFS) server for access by CIFS
clients over the network. A share typically represents a directory tree and its included files
(referred to commonly as a "disk share" or "file share") or a printer (a "print share"). If the
information about the share is saved in persistent store (for example, Windows registry) and
reloaded when a file server is restarted, then the share is referred to as a "sticky share". Some
share names are reserved for specific functions and are referred to as special shares: IPC$,
reserved for interprocess communication, ADMIN$, reserved for remote administration, and A$,
B$, C$ (and other local disk names followed by a dollar sign), assigned to local disk devices.

SMB access protocols: Refers collectively to protocols defined in [MS-CIFS], [MS-SMB], [MS-

SMB2], and [MS-FSCC].

SMB file service: A service on the file server that provides access to files using the SMB access

protocols and related protocols.

SMB Network Redirector: A service that handles requests for remote files and printer operations

by using SMB access protocols.

SMB share: A share that is accessed via the SMB access protocols.

Universal Naming Convention (UNC): A string format that specifies the location of a resource.

For more information, see [MS-DTYP] section 2.2.57.

2  Functional Architecture

This section describes the basic structure of the system and the interrelationships among its parts,
consumers, and dependencies.

2.1  Overview

A goal of information technology (IT) groups is to manage file server resources efficiently while
keeping them available and secure for users. As networks expand to include more users and
servers—whether they are located in one site or in geographically distributed sites—administrators
find it increasingly difficult to keep users connected to the files that they require. On one hand,
distributing resources across a network makes them more available and promotes cross-organizational
efforts. On the other hand, storing files on different file servers that are located throughout an
organization makes it difficult for users to know where to look for information. Administrators also find
it difficult to keep track of all the servers and users who use those servers. The task of replacing an
old server with a new server becomes a major communication chore when users across an
organization have to be notified to update links and file paths.

Within the File Services Management system, the UNC path is usually rendered as
"\\<Server>\<Share>\<Remaining path>", where a share is a specific instance of a file service that is
present on the target server. While a UNC path name can be used to indicate the path to a specific
physical share, it can also be used to virtualize access to shares, through the use of the Distributed
File System (DFS): Referral and the Distributed File System (DFS): Namespace Management
Protocols.

DFS allows administrators to group shared folders that are located on different servers by
transparently connecting them to one or more DFS namespaces. By using the DFS tools, an
administrator selects which shared folders to present in the namespace, designs the hierarchy in
which those folders appear, and determines the names that the shared folders show. When a user
views the namespace, the folders appear to reside on a single, high-capacity hard disk. Users can
navigate the namespace without having to know the server names or shared folders that host the
data.

An admin client uses management protocols to configure and query the state of services, such as
the DFS Service and the File Services. The admin client is also used to configure various policies that
apply to the object store on a file server, such as quotas to limit user disk space use, screening to
restrict the type of content that is allowed to be stored), and other policies.

2.1.1  System Purposes

The purpose of the File Services Management system is to allow an administrator to configure and
monitor file services remotely.

2.1.2  Relationship with External Components

The File Services Management system interacts with several other Windows components. The
following diagram shows the key interactions.

Figure 1: Components interacting with the File Services Management system

File server, file system, domain controller, and printer services are used by the File Services
Management system (FSM system).

File server: A computer hosting one or more instances of a file service, for example, an instance of
an SMB file service. A File Services Management system is used to configure the file servers. File
servers use file systems to store information in the form of files.

File system: A hierarchical store for persistence of user and application data. The File Services
Management system uses a file system to store configuration data and to retrieve the properties of
the file system objects. The File Services Management system depends on an external object store for
storing files and directories, and for changing the configuration of the file system objects. In Windows,
the object store is provided by a local file system, usually the NTFS file system.

Domain controller: Used to store Distributed File System (DFS) namespace metadata if a domain-
based namespace is created. The domain controller is also used to store File Replication Service
(FRS) objects, which store the configuration that is related to all replication members.

Printer services: Printers can be shared by using the File Services Management system. The system
uses printer services to provide printer sharing, where printers can be accessed as described in [MS-
PRSOD]. FSMOD protocols are used to configure the printers and present them to users.

Admin tool: A tool that provides management functionality to the administrator. The admin tool uses
the File Services Management system to configure and retrieve configuration information for the file
servers. It is also used to configure and query the state of the file services.

2.1.3  System Capabilities

The following are the administrative operations that can be performed by using the File Services
Management Protocols:

DFS namespace management: The Distributed File System (DFS) namespace is a virtual view of
resources that reside on one or more file servers. When a user views the namespace, the directories

Release: October 26, 2021

and files in it appear to reside on a single share. Users can navigate the namespace without previous
knowledge of the server names or the shares hosting the data. By using the admin tools, an
administrator selects which shared folders to present in the namespace, designs the hierarchy in
which those folders appear, and determines the names that the shared folders show in the
namespace, as described in Distributed File System (DFS): Namespace Management Protocol [MS-
DFSNM].

Configuring Distributed File System Replication (DFS-R): The administrator can use the admin
tools to create, modify, and delete configuration objects in Active Directory. For this purpose, the
administrator uses the Distributed File System (DFS) Replication Helper Protocol, as described in [MS-
DFSRH].

Monitoring Distributed File System Replication (DFS-R): The administrator can monitor DFS-R
on the server and collect statistics about the DFS-R operation. Information that can be collected
includes:

  Number and size of replicated files on the server.

  Disk use on the server.



Information about replicated folders on the server.

  Replication backlog—the number of files that are not yet fully replicated.

The interfaces that are used to collect these statistics are described in [MS-DFSRH].

Directory quota management: Directory quotas track and control directory space usage for NTFS
file system volumes. Directory quotas allow administrators to control the amount of data that each
user can store on a specific NTFS file system directory. A directory quota can be configured with one
or more directory quota thresholds that define a set of highly customizable notifications that are sent
when the quota usage reaches the threshold value. For more information on how to configure the
directory quota, see the File Server Resource Manager Protocol [MS-FSRM].

File screen management: Administrators can create and modify file screens that restrict the types
of files that can be stored in a specific directory and its subdirectories. For each file screen, there is a
configurable list of blocked file groups that define a set of patterns, based on the file name, which is
to be restricted. When a file is created or renamed, the server evaluates whether the file name
matches a pattern in any file group that is configured on a parent portion of the path. If a match is
found, the file is blocked, and a set of highly customizable File Server Resource Management (FSRM)
notifications that are configured for the file screen are raised. For more information on how to
configure a file screen, see [MS-FSRM].

Analyze storage use: An administrator can generate reports to better understand how storage is
used in specific directories. A storage report job specifies a set of directories to be analyzed to
generate one or more reports. Report jobs can be run on a schedule or on demand. An administrator
can also query and set properties on the report job to manipulate report generation parameters,
format options, email delivery information, and other options. For more information on how to
configure report jobs, see [MS-FSRM].

File classification: An administrator can classify files and apply policies that are based on that
classification. An administrator can retrieve and modify the values that are assigned to classification
properties for files that are stored on the server. An administrator can create, enumerate, modify, and
delete classification rules and classification modules on the server. For more information on how to
configure the file classification, see [MS-FSRM].

Creating and modifying a file management job: A file management job is a scheduled task that
applies a command to a set of files, as determined by lists of conditions and namespaces. File
management jobs can also produce FSRM notifications at configurable intervals before a file is affected
by the configured task.

properties for specific files on the file server by interacting with the FSRM server component.

Configuring the SMB Network Redirector: An administrator can query and configure the SMB
Network Redirector by using the File Services Management system. For example, the administrator
can query the computer name or major and minor version numbers of the operating system from a
remote computer. An administrator can set the following configuration options:







The number of seconds that the SMB Network Redirector maintains an inactive SMB connection to
a remote computer's resource before closing it.

The number of simultaneous network commands that can be processed by the SMB Network
Redirector.

The number of seconds that the SMB Network Redirector waits before the redirector disconnects
an inactive SMB session.

Configuration operations and the protocol that is used to carry out these tasks are described in [MS-
WKST].

Managing information on the SMB server: The administrator can query and configure information
on the server, such as active connections, sessions, shares, files, and transport protocols. A server
can be configured to present different resources based on the name the client connects with, allowing
it to appear as multiple, distinct servers. This task is achieved by scoping a share to a specific name
and by hosting all of the names on the same server. The Server Service Remote Protocol [MS-SRVS]
provides a list of configuration operations.

Managing the SMB server: The administrator can query and configure the SMB server. For example,
the administrator can identify the type of service that the SMB server is running, such as a server
running the Workstation service, change the services that are running, and get a list of all servers of a
specific type in a domain. The administrator can also configure aliases for a server by identifying
multiple distinct names that present the same resources. The protocol that is used to manage an SMB
server is described in [MS-SRVS].

Admin tool: The admin tool is a program that offers management functionality to the administrator
by means of the admin client. Typical admin tools are command-line tools and graphical shells,
management utilities, and graphical management programs. The admin tool is external to the File
Services Management system and uses the admin client to accomplish its work.

Admin client: The admin client is code running on the administrator's computer. The admin client
implements client-side protocol components and consumes the file server administration services that
are offered by the file server. The admin client is internal to the File Services Management system.

FSRM Service: This service implements the server component of the File Server Resource Manager
Protocol [MS-FSRM], and provides interfaces for managing the configuration of directory quotas, file
screens, classification properties, classification rules, file management jobs, report jobs, classifier
modules, and storage modules on a computer. The FSRM Service provides the following features:

  Controls for the quantity of data



 Mechanisms to manage the type of data

  Classification of data

  Application of policy that is based on metadata

  Generation of reports about the data

FRS Service: The File Replication Service (FRS) replicates files and folders that are stored on domain
controllers and Distributed File System (DFS) shared folders. It implements the File Replication
Service Protocol [MS-FRS1] or the Distributed File System Replication Protocol [MS-FRS2]. Both of
these protocols provide similar functionality; however, [MS-FRS1] is deprecated. The File Replication
Service (FRS) also implements the server side of the DFS Replication Helper Protocol [MS-DFSRH],
which is used to configure and monitor Distributed File System Replication (DFS-R) on a server.

SMB File Service: The SMB File Service implements server-side protocol components that are
consumed by the admin client. It also implements the server-side of the Server Service Remote
Protocol (SRVSVC) [MS-SRVS], which is an administrative protocol that is used to query and configure
certain properties of the SMB File Service on a server, such as active connections, sessions, shares,
open files, and transport protocols. It implements the server side of the Workstation Service Remote
Protocol [MS-WKST], which is used to configure the behavior of an SMB Network Redirector.

DFS Service: The DFS Service groups shared folders, which are located on different servers, and
presents them to users as a virtual tree of folders, known as a Distributed File System (DFS)
namespace. The DFS Service implements the server-side protocol components of the Distributed File
System (DFS): Referral (DFSC) Protocol [MS-DFSC] and the Distributed File System (DFS):
Namespace Management Protocol [MS-DFSNM].

Legacy printer service: This service implements the server side of the Remote Administration
Protocol [MS-RAP], which supports certain server administration methods, such as SMB file share
enumeration. This functionality has been superseded by the Workstation Service Remote Protocol
[MS-WKST] and the Server Service Remote Protocol [MS-SRVS].

SMB Network Redirector: A software component on a connected computer that handles requests for
remote files and printer operations. An administrator can configure some aspects of SMB Network
Redirector by using the Workstation Service Remote Protocol [MS-WKST].

Administrator: The administrator is the person who administers the file server. The administrator
organizes the file namespace, sets access rights, and enforces limits through quotas on users’ file
storage. The administrator interacts with the File Services Management system through the admin
tool.

2.1.5  Protocol Relationship

The following diagram shows the protocol layering relationships for the File Services Management
system member protocols that use remote procedure call (RPC) as a transport.

Figure 3: Protocol relationship of RPC-related protocols

The protocols [MS-DFSNM], [MS-SRVS], and [MS-WKST]  use [MS-RPCE] over named pipes. Thus,
the protocols can be transported over SMB access protocols and cannot use any of the other RPC
transports. The File Server Resource Manager Protocol, as described in [MS-FSRM], [MS-DFSRH], [MS-
FRS1], and [MS-FRS2], uses the Remote Procedure Call Protocol Extensions over TCP only. For more
information on the type of RPC transport, see section 2.10.

The following diagram shows the protocol layering relationships of the Remote Administration Protocol
[MS-RAP].

Figure 4: Protocol relationship of the Remote Administration Protocol

The Remote Administration Protocol [MS-RAP] is an administrative protocol that is transported by the
Common Internet File System (CIFS) and the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol, but not by the
Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol Versions 2 and 3 [MS-SMB2]. The function of the Remote
Administration Protocol, as described in [MS-RAP], has largely been replaced by newer protocols. In
the File Services Management system, the Remote Administration Protocol is used as a discovery
protocol. File Services clients can discover servers by using the Remote Administration Protocol to
retrieve a list of servers from the Browser Service, as described in the Common Internet File System
(CIFS) Browser Protocol [MS-BRWS]. The Remote Administration Protocol also supports certain client
and server administration methods, such as SMB file share enumeration, but this functionality has
been superseded by the Workstation Service Remote Protocol [MS-WKST] and the Server Service
Remote Protocol [MS-SRVS].

2.2  Protocol Summary

The following table provides a comprehensive list of the member protocols of the File Services
Management system.

Description

File Server Resource
Manager Protocol

This protocol describes operating system, file system, and storage concepts.
The protocol exposes a set of interfaces that enable tools in a client role to
manage the following:

Short
name

[MS-
FSRM]

Directory quotas to limit the amount of storage capacity in a directory.

File screens to limit the type of files in a directory.

Setup of the file classification that defines the classification property schema
and rules to automatically classify files.

File management tasks that apply simple commands to filtered groups of
files.

Storage reports that cover storage usage and trend analysis.

Query and modification of file classification values by retrieving and setting
classification properties for files, as provided by the FSRM component server
role.

Remote
Administration
Protocol

Distributed File
System (DFS):
Namespace
Management Protocol

DFS Replication Helper
Protocol

This protocol is used to configure the properties and behavior of a Server
Message Block (SMB) Network Redirector (SMB Network Redirector) on a
computer. It is also used to configure domain membership. For example,
this protocol can be used to query the platform identifier, computer name,
or major and minor version numbers of the operating system that runs on a
remote computer. The File Services Management system uses this protocol
to configure an SMB Network Redirector. Other capabilities of this protocol
are not used by the File Services Management system.

[MS-
WKST]

This protocol is used to enable file and printer sharing and named pipe
access to the server through the Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol [MS-
SMB]. The protocol is also used for remote administration of servers that are
running Windows operating systems.

[MS-
SRVS]

This protocol is used for legacy administrative functions which include tasks,
such as share maintenance and printer maintenance on LAN Manager
servers. In addition, the Common Internet File System (CIFS) Browser
Protocol uses the Remote Administration Protocol to enumerate the servers
on the network. Most of this protocol's functionality has been superseded by
the Workstation Service Remote Protocol [MS-WKST], and the Server
Service Remote Protocol [MS-SRVS].

[MS-
RAP]

This protocol is used to create and administer Distributed File System (DFS)
namespaces. DFS namespaces enable the creation of a virtual, contiguous
file system namespace to unify multiple namespaces.

[MS-
DFSNM]

This protocol is a DCOM protocol that can be divided into two parts. One
part consists of interfaces to change, modify, and delete configuration
objects in Active Directory. The second part is an interface to monitor
Distributed File System-Replication (DFS-R) on a server [MS-FRS2] and to
collect various statistics about the DFS Replication operation.

[MS-
DFSRH]

Distributed File
System Replication
Protocol

File Replication
Service Protocol

This protocol is used to replicate files between file servers. It is a
multimaster replication, which enables files to be changed by any member
that participates in replicating shared files. Because it uses an optimistic
replication strategy, files can be updated without any prior consensus or
serialization. DFS-R uses the Remote Differential Compression (RDC)
algorithm. DFS-R supersedes the older FRS replication protocol.

This protocol is an RPC protocol that is used on file servers to replicate files
and folders among file servers on the network. This protocol enables
multimaster file and folder replicas to be synchronized on multiple file
servers. FRS is used to maintain duplicate copies of data files in system
volume (SYSVOL) system folders on domain controllers in a domain. FRS

2.3  Environment

The following sections identify the context in which the system exists. This includes the systems that
use the interfaces that are provided by this system of protocols, other systems that depend on this
system, and, as appropriate, the communication between components of the systems.

2.3.1  Dependencies on This System

File Access Services depends on the File Services Management system for share and namespace
management.

2.3.2  Dependencies on Other Systems/Components

The File Management Services system depends on the following external systems and components:

  Object store: Used to store files and metadata.

  Active Directory system: Used to store Distributed File System (DFS) namespace metadata. If an

Active Directory system is unavailable, an administrator cannot create a domain-based Distributed
File System (DFS) namespace and cannot use the Distributed File System Replication (DFS-R)
Services.

  Authentication Services system: Used to authenticate admin clients and the admin server. The
Authentication services are described in the Authentication Services Protocols Overview [MS-
AUTHSOD].

2.4  Assumptions and Preconditions

The following assumptions and preconditions for the File Services Management system to operate
successfully:

System availability: The File Services Management system must be installed on all computers
involved.

Domain configuration: In a domain configuration, file clients and file services have access to
directory services that are provided by the domain.

Authentication services: Authentication services, as described in [MS-AUTHSOD], are available to
all file clients and file services.

RPC: Components of the file client and file services that use remote procedure call (RPC) interfaces
have all prerequisites satisfied, as described in [MS-RPCE] section 1.5.

Network configuration: For system components that are running on different computers to
communicate, the network services and infrastructure are functional and configured in such a way that
required protocols, ports, and so on are remotely accessible.

Stakeholders

  Administrator

The administrator is the person who administers the file server. The administrator has
administrative rights and uses the File Services Management system to provide the SMB File
Service.

Preconditions

The administrator has identified a file server to which he has to create an alias name. The
administrator has also determined an alias name to add to the server name. An SMB File Service is
present on the file server, as described in [MS-SRVS].

Main Success Scenario

1.  Trigger: The admin tool receives a request from the administrator to add an alias to the file

server.

2.  The admin tool establishes a communication channel to SMB File Service, as described in [MS-

SRVS] section 2.1.

3.  The SMB File Service authenticates the administrator through the mechanisms as described in

[MS-AUTHSOD].

4.  The admin tool contacts the SMB File Service by using the NetrServerAliasAdd method ([MS-

SRVS] section 3.1.4.44), to add an alias to the file server.

2.6  Versioning, Capability Negotiation, and Extensibility

2.6.1  Remote Administration Protocol

The current File Services Management system evolved from earlier systems for remote file access,
including the Microsoft LAN Manager. These early systems did not have a general RPC transport
available to them, and instead defined protocol-specific methods for encoding what would later be
understood to be remote function calls. The Remote Administration Protocol, as described in [MS-
RAP], is such a protocol.

With the introduction of the Microsoft Windows NT 3.1 operating system, an RPC transport, as
described in [MS-RPCE], became available to implementers of the File Services Management system.
Rather than continuing to extend the Remote Administration Protocol, the new Server Service Remote
Protocol [MS-SRVS] was defined. It replaces the use of the Remote Administration Protocol within the
File Services Management system between clients and servers, which is based on the new platforms.
Support for the Remote Administration Protocol was maintained however, for interoperability with pre-
RPC platforms that include the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system.

In the Windows 7 operating system, the Remote Administration Protocol is deprecated. It can only be
used to enumerate file shares.

2.6.2  File Replication Service

The File Replication Service (FRS), as described in [MS-FRS1], is a technology that was originally
introduced in the Microsoft Windows 2000 Server operating system to replicate Distributed File System
(DFS) folders and the SYSVOL folder on domain controllers. Starting with the Windows Server 2003
R2 operating system, Microsoft began to phase out the use of FRS. In the Windows Server 2003 R2
operating system, the DFS Replication (DFS-R) Service replaced FRS for replication of DFS folders,
although FRS was still used to replicate the SYSVOL folder on domain controllers and could be
configured to run on other custom folders.

In the Windows Server 2008 operating system, DFS Replication replaced FRS for replicating the
SYSVOL folder in domains that use the Windows Server 2008 domain functional level. In Windows
Server 2008 R2 operating system, FRS can be used only to replicate the SYSVOL folder on domain
controllers in domains that use the Windows Server 2003 operating system or the Windows 2000
Server domain functional levels.

2.7  Error Handling

2.7.1  Connection Disconnected

A common failure scenario is an unexpected breakdown of the connection between the system and
external entities. A disconnection can be caused when the network is not available or when one of the

54 / 77

[MS-FSMOD] - v20211026
File Services Management Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2021 Microsoft Corporation
Release: October 26, 2021

communicating participants has become unavailable. In the case where the network is not available,
both participants remain active and expect the other party to continue the communication pattern of
the protocol in use at the time of the failure. Similarly, in the case where one of the participants is not
available, the active participant expects the communication to proceed as specified by the protocol in
use.

Generally, a protocol detects a breakdown connection through one of the following methods:

  Use of a timer object that generates an event if the corresponding participant has not responded

within a reasonable time span.

  Notification by the underlying protocol that the connection is disconnected.

When a connection disconnected event is detected, it causes the protocol to initiate a recovery that
can include a breakdown of all related communications and update any necessary data structures to
maintain the system state.

Details about how each protocol detects a connection disconnected event and how it behaves under
this scenario are provided in the specifications of the member protocols.

2.7.2  Internal Failures

The File Service Management system does not defend against internal failures of its state, other than
those that are described in the specifications of the member protocols. The components that comprise
the system mutually determine that each is authoritative at all times.

2.8  Coherency Requirements

Each File Services Management protocol provides its own coherency mechanisms. There are no
coherence mechanisms among dissimilar protocols. Because coherency mechanisms among similar
protocols are specified in the individual protocol documents, there are no system-level coherency
requirements.

2.9  Security

Versioning of security is handled by the underlying RPC transport. For more information, see Remote
Procedure Call Protocol Extensions ([MS-RPCE] section 3.3.3).

Figure 13: Sequence diagram for creating and managing a namespace

1.  CreateNamespace: The administrator requests that the admin tool creates a DFS namespace on
the previously configured SMB share. The admin tool specifies the server, the share name, and
various other options that are specific to the creation of the namespace.

2.  Create DFS Namespace: The admin tool makes use of the admin client to create a DFS

namespace. The sequence of steps is described in Task 1: Creating a DFS domain namespace.

3.  CreateLink: The administrator requests that the admin tool create a DFS link in the DFS

namespace. The admin tool specifies the server and share name of the namespace, the path at
which the link is created, the target of the link, and various other options that are specific to
creating the link.

4.  Create DFS Link: The admin tool makes use of the admin client to create a DFS link. The

sequence of steps is described in Task 2: Creating a DFS Link.

5.  CreateReplicationGroup (Optional): The administrator requests that the admin tool creates an

FRS replica group. It specifies the domain controller and the group members.

6.  Create DFS-R Replication group (Optional): The admin tool makes use of the admin client to
create a replication group. The sequence of steps is described in Task 3: Creating a Replication
Group (Optional).

Note: The admin tool uses the NetrDfsEnum method ([MS-DFSNM] section 3.1.4.1.7), or the
NetrDfsEnumEx method ([MS-DFSNM] section 3.1.4.2.3) to enumerate the DFS root that is hosted
on a server or the DFS links of the namespace that are hosted by a server. The admin tool calls the

Release: October 26, 2021

61 / 77

NetrDfsManagerGetVersion method ([MS-DFSNM] section 3.1.4.1.2) to determine the enumeration
method to use. The admin tool calls these enumeration methods multiple times to refresh its list.

Task 1: Creating a DFS Domain Namespace

The following example describes the steps that are used to create a DFS domain namespace. The DFS
service that is used in this example resides on the root target server.

The following sequence diagram shows the steps to create a DFS domain namespace.

Figure 14: Sequence diagram for creating a DFS domain namespace

1.  The admin client calls the NetrDfsAddRootTarget method ([MS-DFSNM] section 3.1.4.1.9). The

admin client specifies the server, the share to host the namespace, and various options that are
provided by the administrator.<1>

2.  The DFS Service creates a new DFS namespace Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

entry with the DFS namespace anchor LDAP entry as its parent. The server also creates the DFS
metadata that is required for the new DFS namespace and updates the DFS metadata in the
object that corresponds to the DFS namespace. This update appears as an LDAP Add operation to
the domain controller.

3.  The DFS metadata write operation is successful, and the domain controller returns

LDAP_SUCCESS to indicate success.

4.  The DFS Service completes the NetrDfsAddRootTarget method and returns a success code to

the admin client.

Task 2: Creating a DFS Link

The following example describes the steps that are used to add a new DFS link to an existing
domainv2-based DFS namespace with one root target. The DFS service that is used in this
example resides on the root target server.

Figure 15: Sequence diagram for adding a DFS link

5.  The admin tool requests the admin client to create the given DFS link in the DFS namespace,

which is hosted by the server that is identified in the RPC calling context. The admin client calls
the NetrDfsAdd method ([MS-DFSNM] section 3.1.4.1.3) that specifies the link path, target, and
other options.

6.  The DFS service verifies the existence of the namespace name and the link ([MS-DFSNM] section

3.1.4.1.3).

7.  The DFS service issues an LDAP Add request to the domain controller with the updated DFS

metadata that contains the new DFS link information for a domainv2-based DFS namespace ([MS-
DFSNM] section 3.1.4.1.3).

8.  The LDAP Add operation is successful and the LDAP server returns an LDAP_SUCCESS message to

the DFS service.

9.  The NetrDfsAdd method that is invoked by the admin client finishes successfully. The DFS service

returns a success code to the admin client.

Task 3: Creating a Replication Group (Optional)

The following example describes the steps to create a replication group on a domain controller.

The following sequence diagram shows the steps to create a replication group.

Figure 16: Sequence diagram for creating a replication group

10. The admin client calls the CreateObject method of the DFS-R Service that passes the domain

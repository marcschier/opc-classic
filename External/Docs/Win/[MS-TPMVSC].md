1  Introduction

The DCOM Interfaces for Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Virtual Smart Card Management Protocol is
used to manage virtual smart cards (VSCs) on a remote machine, such as those based on trusted
platform modules (TPM). It provides methods for a protocol client to request creation and destruction
of VSCs and to monitor the status of these operations.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

1.1  Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

certification authority (CA): A third party that issues public key certificates. Certificates serve to
bind public keys to a user identity. Each user and certification authority (CA) can decide whether
to trust another user or CA for a specific purpose, and whether this trust is to be transitive. For
more information, see [RFC3280].

virtual smart card (VSC): A combination of hardware, software, and firmware that implements
the same interface as a smart card but is not necessarily restricted to the same physical form
factors. For example, virtual smart cards can be implemented entirely in software, or they can
use the cryptographic capabilities of specific hardware such as a TPM.

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

1.2  References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the
most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents
in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not
match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the Errata.

1.3  Overview

The DCOM Interfaces for the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Virtual Smart Card Management Protocol
provides a Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol [MS-DCOM] interface used
for creating and destroying VSCs. Like all other DCOM interfaces, this protocol uses RPC [C706], with
the extensions specified in [MS-RPCE], as its underlying protocol. A VSC is a device that presents a
device interface complying with the PC/SC specification for PC-connected interface devices [PCSC3] to
its host operating system (OS) platform. This protocol does not assume anything about the underlying
implementation of VSC devices. In particular, while it is primarily intended for the management of
VSCs based on TPMs, it can also be used to manage other types of VSCs. The protocol defines two
interfaces: a primary interface which is used to request VSC operations on a target system, and a
secondary interface which is used by that target system to return status and progress information to
the requestor.

In a typical scenario, this protocol is used by a requestor (generally an administrative workstation) to
manage VSC devices on a target (generally an end-user workstation). The requestor, acting as a
client, connects to the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager, ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2, or
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3 interface on the target (which acts as the server) and requests the
target to either create or destroy a VSC by passing appropriate parameters. These parameters include
a reference to an ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback DCOM interface on the requestor that
can be used to provide status updates through callbacks.

The principal difference between the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2 interface and the
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3 interface is that the latter supports creation of attestation-capable
virtual smart cards.

The principal difference between the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager interface and the
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2 interface is that the latter supports policies to define valid values for
the smart-card PIN.

The target, after validating these parameters, starts executing the requested operation. It also opens
a second connection back to the requestor over which it invokes the requestor’s
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback interface as a client, and calls the appropriate functions
of that interface to provide progress or error codes. When the operation is completed, the target
closes this second connection and returns the result for the requestor’s original method invocation.

This entire process is illustrated in Figure 1.

1.4  Relationship to Other Protocols

The DCOM Interfaces for the TPM Virtual Smart Card Management Protocol relies on the Distributed
Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol, as specified in [MS-DCOM], which uses RPC [MS-
RPCE] as its transport. A diagram of these relationships is shown in the following figure:

Figure 2: Protocol Relationships

1.5  Prerequisites/Preconditions

This protocol is implemented over DCOM and RPC. Therefore, it has the prerequisites specified in [MS-
DCOM] and [MS-RPCE] as being common to protocols that depend on DCOM and RPC respectively.

This protocol also requires a compliant implementation of [PCSC3], as well as any additional host OS
facilities required to support the creation of VSCs, on the target.

This protocol requires the use of a secure RPC connection. The requestor is required to possess the
credentials of an administrative user on the target, and both requestor and target are required to
support security packages that implement support for impersonation as well as packet privacy and
integrity.

1.6  Applicability Statement

This protocol is applicable to scenarios where it is desirable to remotely manage VSC devices on a
computer with a smart card implementation compliant with [PCSC3].

1.7  Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas:

  Supported Transports: This protocol uses the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)

Remote Protocol [MS-DCOM], which in turn uses RPC over TCP as its only transport, as specified in
section 2.1.

  Protocol Versions: This protocol includes two DCOM interfaces (namely

ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager and ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback), both of which
are version 0.0 as defined in section 2.2.

  Security and Authentication Methods: Microsoft RPC, as defined in [MS-RPCE], is used to

negotiate the authentication mechanism, as specified in [MS-SPNG] and in section 3.1.

  Localization: This protocol uses predefined status codes and error codes. It is the caller’s

responsibility to localize the status and error codes to localized strings.

  Capability Negotiation: This protocol does not support explicit capability negotiation. However,

as specified in section 3.1.4, the requestor can disable the use of the
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback interface by providing a NULL callback parameter.
Even if a callback parameter is provided by the requestor, the target can choose to not use the
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback interface.

1.8  Vendor Extensible Fields

This protocol uses HRESULT values as defined in [MS-ERREF] section 2.1. Vendors can define their
own HRESULT values, provided they set the C bit (0x20000000) for each vendor-defined value,
indicating the value is a customer code.

2.1  Transport

This protocol uses RPC dynamic endpoints as defined in Part 4 of [C706].

The client and server MUST communicate by using the DCOM Remote Protocol [MS-DCOM]. DCOM, in
turn, uses RPC with the ncacn_ip_tcp (RPC over TCP) protocol sequence, as specified in [MS-RPCE].

The server MUST use the RPC security extensions specified in [MS-RPCE] in the manner specified in
section 3.1.3 and section 3.1.4. It MUST support the use of Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation
Mechanism (SPNEGO) [MS-SPNG] [RFC4178] to negotiate security providers, and it MUST register one
or more security packages that can be negotiated using this protocol.

A server RPC interface implementing one of the DCOM interfaces specified by this protocol MUST use
the appropriate UUID as specified in section 1.9.

The RPC version number for all interfaces MUST be 0.0.

2.2  Common Data Types

This protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to support both the NDR and NDR64 transfer
syntaxes and provide a negotiation mechanism for determining which transfer syntax will be used, as
specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

In addition to the RPC base types and definitions specified in [C706] and [MS-RPCE], additional data
types are defined in this section.

3  Protocol Details

Implementations of this protocol MUST implement support for ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager and
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback. They SHOULD<3> implement support for
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2 and ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3.

The client side of the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager, ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2, and
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3 interfaces is simply a pass-through. That is, no additional timers or
other state is required on the client side of these interfaces. Calls made by the higher-layer protocol or
application are passed directly to the transport, and the results returned by the transport are passed
directly back to the higher-layer protocol or application. The set of in-progress calls is made available
to the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback server as specified in section 3.2.1.

Similarly, the client side of the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback interface is also a pass-
through and requires no additional timers or other state. This protocol is only intended to be invoked
by the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager, ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2, or
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3 server while processing a call to one of its methods. When invoked in
this way, the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback client simply passes the call directly to the
underlying DCOM transport, using the same causality ID as the triggering
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager, ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager2, or ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager3
call as specified in [MS-DCOM] section 3.2.4.2.

3.1  ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager Server Details

3.1.1  Abstract Data Model

This protocol maintains no state. However, as specified in section 1.5, it assumes that the server has
access to a smart card implementation compliant with [PCSC3] and associated facilities for creating
VSCs. Those components are able to maintain implementation-specific state.

3.1.2  Timers

None.

3.1.3  Initialization

The server MUST register itself with the DCOM infrastructure and bind to a dynamic endpoint obtained
from the RPC runtime.

The server MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to negotiate security contexts by using the
SPNEGO protocol ([RFC4178]). The server SHOULD request the RPC runtime to reject any
unauthenticated connections.

The server MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to perform a strict NDR data consistency check
at target level 6.0, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

The server MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to reject a NULL unique or full pointer with non-
zero conformant value, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 3.

The server MUST confirm the presence of an underlying smart card infrastructure complying with
[PCSC3]. If no such infrastructure is present, the server MUST stop initialization and exit with an
error.

3.1.4  Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

This interface includes the following methods:

Description

CreateVirtualSmartCard

Opnum: 3

DestroyVirtualSmartCard  Opnum: 4

3.1.4.1  CreateVirtualSmartCard (Opnum 3)

This method is invoked by the requestor to create a VSC on the target.

 HRESULT CreateVirtualSmartCard(
         [in, string] const wchar_t* pszFriendlyName,
         [in] unsigned char bAdminAlgId,
         [in, size_is(cbAdminKey)] const unsigned char* pbAdminKey,

         [out, string] wchar_t** ppszInstanceId,
         [out] int* pfNeedReboot);

pszFriendlyName: A Unicode string for use in any user interface messages relating to this VSC.

bAdminAlgId: An unsigned byte value. This parameter MUST be set to 0x82.

pbAdminKey:  An array of 24 bytes containing a TDEA [SP800-67] key intended to be used as the

administrative key for the new VSC.

cbAdminKey: A 32-bit unsigned integer value. It MUST be set to 24.

pbAdminKcv:  An array of bytes containing the Key Check Value (KCV) for the administrative key

contained in the pbAdminKey parameter. This parameter is optional and MUST be set to NULL if
absent. If present, it MUST be computed by encrypting eight zero bytes using the TDEA [SP800-
67] block cipher and taking the first three bytes.

cbAdminKcv: A 32-bit unsigned integer value. It MUST be set to 0 if the pbAdmin parameter is NULL,

and MUST be set to 3 otherwise.

pbPuk:  An array of bytes containing the desired PUK for the new VSC. This parameter is optional and
MUST be set to NULL if absent. If present, its length MUST be between 8 and 127 bytes, inclusive.

cbPuk: A 32-bit unsigned integer value. It MUST be equal to the length of the pbPuk parameter in

bytes. If pbPuk is NULL, this parameter MUST be set to 0.

pbPin: An array of bytes containing the desired PIN for the new VSC. Its length MUST be between 8

and 127 bytes, inclusive.

cbPin: A 32-bit unsigned integer value. It MUST be equal to the length of the pbPin parameter in

bytes.

pStatusCallback: A reference to an instance of the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback

DCOM interface on the requestor. The server uses this interface to provide feedback on progress
and errors. This parameter is optional and MUST be set to NULL if absent.

ppszInstanceId: A Unicode string containing a unique instance identifier for the VSC created by this

operation.

pfNeedReboot: A Boolean value that indicates whether or not a reboot is required on the server

before the newly-created VSC is made available to applications.

Return Values: The server MUST return 0 if it successfully creates the new VSC, and a nonzero value

otherwise.

Exceptions Thrown: No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol

[MS-RPCE].

The server MUST validate the parameters before executing the requested operation and fail requests
with invalid parameters.

If pbAdminKcv is present, the server MUST perform admin key integrity check. The admin key
integrity check is done by encrypting eight zero bytes using the TDEA [SP800-67] block cipher, taking
the first 3 bytes and verifying that it matches the provided pbAdminKcv value. If the computed bytes
do not match the provided pbAdminKcv value, the admin key integrity check fails and the server
MUST fail the requested operation.

If pbPuk is present, the server MUST create a VSC that supports PUK-based PIN reset and its PUK is
set as the provided pbPuk value. Otherwise, the server MUST create a VSC that supports challenge-
response-based PIN reset through the admin role.

Upon successful creation of a VSC, the server MUST initialize all data structures necessary for the
VSC, and register it with the underlying smart card implementation compliant with [PCSC3]. The
server MUST allocate an instance identifier to the newly-created VSC that is unique among all such
identifiers in use at that time.

If pStatusCallback is present, the server SHOULD notify the client of the progress and errors of the
undergoing operation, as specified in section 3.2.4. The status callback happens synchronously with
the requested operation. If the status callback returns an error code, the server MUST abort the VSC
creation and return a non-zero error to the client, with the severity bit in the error code set to 1. In
this case, the server SHOULD also roll back all changes made in respect to the requested operation.

3.1.4.2  DestroyVirtualSmartCard (Opnum 4)

This method is invoked by the requestor to destroy a previously-created VSC on the target.

 HRESULT DestroyVirtualSmartCard(
         [in, string] const wchar_t* pszInstanceId,
         [in, unique] ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback* pStatusCallback,
         [out] int* pfNeedReboot);

pszInstanceId: A Unicode string containing the instance identifier for the VSC to be destroyed.

pStatusCallback: A reference to an instance of the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback

DCOM interface on the requestor. The server uses this interface to provide feedback on progress
and errors. This parameter is optional and MUST be set to NULL if absent.

pfNeedReboot: A Boolean value that indicates whether or not a reboot is required on the server to

complete the destruction of the VSC.

Return Values: The server MUST return 0 if it successfully locates and destroys the indicated VSC,

and a nonzero value otherwise.

Exceptions Thrown: No exceptions are thrown beyond those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol

[MS-RPCE].

The server MUST validate the parameters before executing the requested operation and fail requests
with invalid parameters.

In response to the request, the server MUST locate the VSC using the provided instance identifier from
the underlying smart card implementation compliant with [PCSC3], remove its registration with the
implementation, and clear all data structures associated with the VSC.

If pStatusCallback is present, the server SHOULD notify the client of the progress and errors of the
undergoing operation, as specified in section 3.2.4. The status callback happens synchronously with
the requested operation. If the status callback returns an error code, the server SHOULD try to abort
the requested operation and roll back all changes related to the operation. If the operation is aborted,
the server MUST return a non-zero error code to the client, with the severity bit in the error code set
to 1. If the operation cannot be aborted, the server MUST ignore the error from the status callback
interface and complete the requested operation.

4  Protocol Examples

4.1  Create a VSC without Status Callback

Since the status callback interface is optional when creating a VSC, the requestor cannot provide a
callback interface to the target. In this case, the requestor is only notified through the return value
when the requested operation has been completed on the target.

The following figure shows the communication between the requestor and the target when creating a
VSC without a requestor-provided callback interface.

Figure 3: Create a VSC without status callback

4.2  Create a VSC with Status Callback

When creating a VSC on the target, the requestor can provide a callback interface to receive progress
and error notifications from the target while the requested operation is being executed on the target.

The following figure shows the communications between the requestor and the target when creating a
VSC with a requestor-provided callback interface.

Figure 4: Create a VSC with status callback

In this example, the requestor returns zero for each call to
ITpmVirtualSmartCardManagerStatusCallback::ReportProgress. For brevity, these returns are omitted
from the diagram.

5  Security

5.1  Security Considerations for Implementers

This protocol uses DCOM as its underlying transport. Therefore, all security considerations that apply
to DCOM interfaces, as specified in [MS-DCOM] section 5, are also applicable to this protocol.

The ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager interface allows the requestor to alter system state on the target
computer in a persistent way. Therefore, as specified in section 3.1.4, any server implementation of
this interface has to ensure that the requestor has appropriate administrative privileges.

In addition, some of the parameters to the ITpmVirtualSmartCardManager methods, in particular the
PIN, PUK, and administrative keys, contain sensitive information. It is recommended that the client
and server take reasonable measures to protect these parameter values, including not writing them to
persistent storage and erasing them from memory immediately after use.

The underlying VSC implementation is required to implement appropriate security measures as well.
In particular, any keys it generates need to be cryptographically random and not written to unsecured
storage in the clear. When a VSC is destroyed, its contents are also destroyed to prevent possible
future recovery of its key material.

Sharing AIKs between VSCs allows linking of those VSCs by anyone who sees attestation statements
from both VSCs. This can be a privacy issue in some cases. Client implementations can avoid privacy
issues by not sharing AIKs and AIK certificates between VSCs.

The security of the attestation relies on the security properties of the TPM itself. Any weaknesses in
the TPM implementation will correspondingly affect the strength of the assurance provided by the
attestation statement. Implementers are advised to take this into account when deciding whether to
implement this protocol on a particular platform.

The security assurance of attestation statements issued by the VSC depends on how strongly the AIK
is believed to be associated with a secure TPM. When deploying this protocol, it is important to ensure
the integrity of the process for issuing AIK certificates (or for determining the AIKs associated with a
given platform, if certificates are not used). In addition, it is important to ensure the security of the
PKI that issues the AIK certificates and to follow good certificate management practices.

## 1 Introduction

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Remote Protocol is a Distributed Component Object
Model (DCOM), as specified in [MS-DCOM], a client/server–based framework that provides an open
and automated means of systems management. WMI leverages the Common Information Model
(CIM), as specified in [DMTF-DSP0004], to represent various components of the operating system.
CIM is the conceptual model for storing enterprise management information. The information available
from CIM is specified by a series of classes and associations, and the elements contained in them
(methods, properties, and references). These constructs describe the data available to WMI clients.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

### 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

activation: In COM, a local mechanism by which a client provides the CLSID of an object class
and obtains an object, either an object from that object class or a class factory that is able to
create such objects.

amended qualifier: A qualifier whose value can be localized to the desired locale as needed. For
example, a description qualifier can be localized to give the description of the subject in the
user's locale.

asynchronous operation: An operation executed on the server side. The client continues

executing and does not check whether a response is available from the server.

Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF): A modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF),

commonly used by Internet specifications. ABNF notation balances compactness and simplicity
with reasonable representational power. ABNF differs from standard BNF in its definitions and
uses of naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. For more
information, see [RFC5234].

authentication level: A numeric value indicating the level of authentication or message protection

that remote procedure call (RPC) will apply to a specific message exchange. For more
information, see [C706] section 13.1.2.1 and [MS-RPCE].

CIM class: A CIM object that represents a CIM class definition as a CIM object. It is the

template representing a manageable entity with a set of properties and methods.

CIM database: A persistent database that holds information about CIM objects and namespaces.

CIM instance: An instantiation of a CIM class representing a manageable entity.

CIM localizable information: The portion of information in a CIM class definition that could be

language-specific or country-specific.

CIM method: An operation describing the behavior of a CIM class or a CIM instance. It is

generally an action that can be performed against the manageable entity made up of a CIM
class.

CIM namespace: A logical grouping of a set of CIM classes designed for the same purpose or
sharing a common management objective within the database used to store all CIM class
definitions.

CIM object: Refers to a CIM class or a CIM instance.

class identifier (CLSID): A GUID that identifies a software component; for instance, a DCOM

object class or a COM class.

client: Identifies the system that consumes WMI services and initiates DCOM ([MS-DCOM]) calls to

WMI servers.

Common Information Model (CIM): The Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) model that

describes how to represent real-world computer and network objects. CIM uses an object-
oriented paradigm, where managed objects are modeled using the concepts of classes and
instances. See [DMTF-DSP0004].

Common Information Model (CIM) class: A collection of Common Information Model (CIM)
instances that support the same type, that is, the same CIM properties and CIM methods, as
specified in [DMTF-DSP0004].

Common Information Model (CIM) instance: Provides values for the CIM properties associated
with the CIM instance's defining CIM class. A CIM instance does not carry values for any
other CIM properties or CIM methods that are not defined in (or inherited by) its defining CIM
class. For more information, see [DMTF-DSP0004].

Common Information Model (CIM) object: An object that represents a Common Information

Model (CIM) object. This can be either a CIM class or a CIM instance of a CIM class.

Common Information Model (CIM) path: A string expression locating a class or an instance of
a class in the operating system. The CIM path includes the computer name, the namespace,
the name of CIM class, and the unique identifier locating the CIM class or CIM instance.

Common Information Model (CIM) property: Assigns values used to characterize instances of
a CIM class. A CIM property can be thought of as a pair of Get and Set functions that, when
applied to an object, return state and set state, respectively. For more information, see [DMTF-
DSP0004].

Common Information Model (CIM) relative path: A string expression where elements like the

computer and/or the namespace of the CIM class and/or CIM instance are not used.

Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM): The Microsoft Component Object Model (COM)
specification that defines how components communicate over networks, as specified in [MS-
DCOM].

dynamic disk: A disk on which volumes can be composed of more than one partition on disks of

the same pack, as opposed to basic disks where a partition and a volume are equivalent.

empty CIM object: A data structure conforming to the Windows Management Instrumentation

(WMI) serialization model having no properties, method, or derivation.

extrinsic event: An event that is generated by a component outside the implementation.

globally unique identifier (GUID): A term used interchangeably with universally unique

identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of

language code identifier (LCID): A 32-bit number that identifies the user interface human

language dialect or variation that is supported by an application or a client computer.

manageable entity: A Common Information Model (CIM) instance that represents a

manageable component of an operating system.

managed object: The actual item in the system environment that is accessed by the provider, as

described in [DMTF-DSP0004].

Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL): The Microsoft implementation and extension
of the OSF-DCE Interface Definition Language (IDL). MIDL can also mean the Interface
Definition Language (IDL) compiler provided by Microsoft. For more information, see [MS-
RPCE].

opnum: An operation number or numeric identifier that is used to identify a specific remote

procedure call (RPC) method or a method in an interface. For more information, see [C706]
section 12.5.2.12 or [MS-RPCE].

qualifier: Additional information about a class, property, method or method parameter. For

example, an abstract qualifier describes that the class is abstract and cannot have instances, an
IN qualifier describes the method parameter is used as input parameter.

security principal: A unique entity identifiable through cryptographic means by at least one key.
A security principal often corresponds to a human user but can also be a service offering a
resource to other security principals. Sometimes referred to simply as a "principal".

security provider: A pluggable security module that is specified by the protocol layer above the
remote procedure call (RPC) layer, and will cause the RPC layer to use this module to secure
messages in a communication session with the server. The security provider is sometimes
referred to as an authentication service. For more information, see [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI): An API that allows connected applications to call
one of several security providers to establish authenticated connections and to exchange data
securely over those connections. It is equivalent to Generic Security Services (GSS)-API, and
the two are on-the-wire compatible.

semisynchronous operation: An operation that is executed on the server side while the client is

regularly checking to see if there is no response available from the server.

server: Used to identify the system that implements WMI services, provides management

services, and accepts DCOM ([MS-DCOM]) calls from WMI clients.

static CIM object: A CIM class or instance whose content is stored in the CIM database.

static mapping or record: A manually created entry in the database of a NBNS server.

superclasses and subclasses: Types of Common Information Model (CIM) classes. A

subclass is derived from a superclass. The subclasses inherit all features of its superclass but
can add new features or redefine existing ones. A superclass is the CIM class from which a CIM
class inherits.

synchronous operation: An operation that is executed on the server side while the client is

waiting for the response message.

Unicode character: Unless otherwise specified, a 16-bit UTF-16 code unit.

universally unique identifier (UUID): A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple

purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very
persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager
entry-point vectors, and RPC objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also
known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in

the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does
not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the
use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [RFC4122] or [C706]
has to be used for generating the UUID.

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): The Microsoft implementation of Common
Information Model (CIM), as specified in [DMTF-DSP0004]. WMI allows an administrator to
manage local and remote machines and models computer and network objects using an
extension of the CIM standard.

WMI Query Language (WQL): A subset of American National Standards Institute Structured

Query Language (ANSI SQL). It differs from the standard SQL in that it retrieves from classes
rather than tables and returns CIM classes or instances rather than rows.  WQL is specified in

### 1.3 Overview

The Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Remote Protocol is used to communicate
management data conforming to Common Information Model (CIM), as specified in [DMTF-
DSP0004]. The Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol uses CIM as the conceptual
model for representing enterprise management information that can be managed by an administrator.
However WMI is not fully compliant with [DMTF-DSP0004]. The exceptions are documented where
applicable in the WMI Remote Protocol.

The Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol is implemented as a three-tier
architecture, as illustrated in the following figure.

Figure 1: Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol architecture

At layer 3, the Providers are designed to interact locally with WMI Management Data Sources.
Providers implement abstract interface as specified in section 3.1.4.17. Windows Management
Instrumentation Remote Protocol management data sources are designed to interact locally with
manageable entities. Layer 2 supports the core of the Windows Management Instrumentation
Remote Protocol service and is called the CIM Object Manager (CIMOM). CIMOM interacts with CIM
database for storing or accessing CIM class and CIM instances that are static CIM object; CIM
providers for storing or accessing CIM class and CIM instances that are dynamic from the [DMTF-
DSP0004]. WMI DCOM Client Interfaces in Layer 1 and WMI DCOM Server Interfaces in Layer 2
implement the Distributed Component Object Model interfaces (as specified in [MS-DCOM]]) that
are used by the Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol to communicate over the
network between Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol clients and servers. This
layer is the only layer that communicates over the network. Network communication is achieved by
using the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) Remote Protocol and a set of Windows
Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol DCOM interfaces, as specified in section 3.1.4.

Figure 2: Clients can be local or remote from the server

Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol clients can be local or remote from the
server, as illustrated in the preceding figure. In either case, the same set of Windows Management
Instrumentation Remote Protocol interfaces is used.

The communication works the same way between clients and server; all interactions between clients
and server are made through the DCOM Remote Protocol locally or remotely. Therefore, clients are
always acting in a message submission mode through the DCOM Remote Protocol to leverage the
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol interfaces that are implemented on the server
side.

The client can call the server in one of the following ways:

  Synchronous calls

16 / 234

[MS-WMI] - v20240423
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


  Semisynchronous calls

  Asynchronous calls

The server APIs for synchronous and semisynchronous APIs are the same, but the call is executed
synchronously if the flags do not contain WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY. If the flag
WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY is specified, the call is executed semisynchronously. Examples of
such APIs include IWbemServices::GetObject (section 3.1.4.3.4),
IWbemServices::PutClass (section 3.1.4.3.6), and so on.

The IWbemServices methods that end with Async are asynchronous counterparts for their
synchronous APIs. Example of async APIs are IWbemServices::GetObjectAsync (section 3.1.4.3.5),
IWbemServices::PutClassAsync (section 3.1.4.3.7), and so on

The management information that is exchanged between clients and server (and server and clients) is
transmitted over the network by the Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol as a
custom-marshaled payload, as specified in [MS-DCOM] section 2.2.18.6.

The Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol serializes the management information
that is transmitted, as specified in [MS-WMIO]. Before reading this Windows Management
Instrumentation Remote Protocol document, acquire a working knowledge of the concepts, structures,
and communication protocols as specified in [MS-DCOM], [DMTF-DSP0004], and [MS-WMIO].
Namespace security is controlled by using security descriptors, as specified in [MS-DTYP].

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol uses the DCOM Remote Protocol to
communicate over the network and to authenticate all requests issued against the infrastructure. The
DCOM Remote Protocol is actually the foundation for the Windows Management Instrumentation
Remote Protocol and is used to accomplish the following:



Establish the protocol.

  Secure the communication channel.

  Authenticate clients.



Implement reliable communication between clients and servers.

This implies that the DCOM Remote Protocol implementation provides and uses all underlying
protocols, as specified in [MS-RPCE], [MS-DCOM], and [C706].

In addition to DCOM Remote Protocol support, the Windows Management Instrumentation Remote
Protocol uses a special encoding, as specified in [MS-WMIO], to transfer information as specified in
[DMTF-DSP0004] over the network.

### 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The client that uses the protocol possesses valid credentials that are recognized by the server
accepting the client requests. The client uses security providers that recognize such credentials to
authenticate to the remote server by using the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI), which
is supported by the Remote Procedure Call Protocol Extensions, as specified in [MS-RPCE].

The server system is started with the DCOM Remote Protocol activation service fully initialized before
the activation request. The client is configured to receive activation requests from the server if it
wants to call the service asynchronously, as specified in section 4.4.

An implementation of the DCOM Remote Protocol, as specified in [MS-DCOM], needs to be available.

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

The Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol implementation is designed for managing
components that are represented by CIM classes on remote clients and servers. This protocol is
designed to act as a transport for CIM-compatible management objects and operations on CIM
objects.

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

This document covers versioning issues in the following areas. The Windows Management
Instrumentation Remote Protocol does explicit negotiation as follows:







The client of this protocol uses the mechanism, as specified in [MS-DCOM] section 1.7, to discover
which interfaces are supported by the exported object and to interpret the E_NOINTERFACE result,
as specified in [MS-DCOM] section 1.7. The client then adjusts its behavior based on the
availability of the requested interface, as specified in sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4.2.8.

The protocol uses return codes as a capability discovery mechanism; the client interprets them as
a capability negotiation, as specified in section 3.2.4.1.1.

The protocol uses return values and parameters to negotiate the locale capabilities of the server
as specified in section 3.2.3.

### 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

In order to extend the CIM schema using the Windows Management Instrumentation Remote
Protocol, vendors MUST use operations as specified in section 3.1.4.3.

This protocol uses HRESULT values as specified in [MS-ERREF]. Vendors can define their own
HRESULT values, provided they set the C bit (0x20000000) for each vendor-defined value, indicating
that the value is a customer code.

### 1.9 Standards Assignments

There are no standards assignments for this protocol. This protocol uses the following class
identifiers (CLSIDs) (as specified in [MS-DCOM] section 1.9):

  CLSID_WbemLevel1Login ({8BC3F05E-D86B-11D0-A075-00C04FB68820})

  CLSID_WbemBackupRestore ({C49E32C6-BC8B-11D2-85D4-00105A1F8304})

The following GUIDs are used for the interfaces:

















IID_IWbemLevel1Login ({F309AD18-D86A-11d0-A075-00C04FB68820})

## 2 Messages

The following sections specify how Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol messages
are transported and specify Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol message syntax.

### 2.1 Transport

Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol messages MUST be transported via the DCOM
Remote Protocol. The Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol objects that are
exported by the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) server MUST be capable of
DCOM activation, as specified in [MS-DCOM] section 3.2.4.1.1.

The client connection MUST be secured at an authentication level that is negotiated by the DCOM
Remote Protocol infrastructure.

### 2.2 Common Data Types

#### 2.2.1 WQL Query

A client has the capability to express a query against a server. This query MUST be expressed in the
WMI Query Language (WQL). WQL is a subset of the American National Standards Institute
Structured Query Language, as specified in [FIPS127] and [MSDN-WQL]. WQL differs from the
standard SQL in that WQL retrieves from classes rather than tables, and returns CIM classes or CIM
instances rather than rows. WQL supports a specific semantic designed to query against CIM classes
or CIM instances with their related characteristics. Queries MUST be of one of the following 3 forms:

  Schema queries: Queries focused on CIM classes.

  Data queries: Queries focused on CIM instances.



Event queries: Queries focused on events triggered by state changes of CIM classes or CIM
instances. Events triggered on CIM instances can be internal to the infrastructure (intrinsic) or
external to the infrastructure (extrinsic). Events can also be timer events.

WQL uses terminologies and concepts, as specified in [DMTF-DSP0004], except as noted below, and
requires familiarity with the CIM model. The server MUST treat a backslash as an escape character in
a WQL query, except within a LIKE clause. The server MUST treat literal strings in WQL data as case-
insensitive, contrary to what [DMTF-DSP0004] specifies.

The next section specifies the complete syntax of WQL queries for schema, data, and event queries.

##### 2.2.1.1 WQL Schema and Data Query

The syntax for the WQL schema and data queries is provided in Augmented Backus-Naur Form
(ABNF).

a ('').

CLASS-NAME

Identifies the CIM class name to be queried.

PROPERTY-NAME

Identifies the name of a property of the CIM class.

QUALIFIER-NAME

In the context of a WQL query, QUALIFIER-NAME is an attribute of a PROPERTY-NAME
defining the nature of an association with another CIM class. All qualifiers, including
any custom-defined qualifier, MUST be supported within the context of a WQL query.

DATA-WQL

SELECT

A string expressing the WQL query. The WQL string uses different WQL reserved
keywords to select the type of information desired.

A keyword expressing the selection of information requested (similar to SQL SELECT).
SELECT expresses the CIM class or CIM instance to be queried. It MUST be specified
when the ASSOCIATORS OF or the REFERENCES OF keyword is not used. It MUST NOT
be used when the ASSOCIATORS OF or the REFERENCES OF keyword is used.

PROPERTY-LIST

A list of PROPERTY-NAME values. PROPERTY-NAME values in the list MUST be
separated by a comma (",").

ASTERISK

Requires all properties of a CIM class or a CIM instance.

FROM

 A keyword that MUST be specified with the SELECT statement to express the CIM
class or CIM instance the query MUST be executed against.

OPTIONAL-SEL-WHERE

The WHERE statement narrows the scope of a SELECT.

OPTIONAL-META-
WHERE

The WHERE statement narrows the scope of a SELECT. The WHERE statement followed
by the __THIS ISA statement is narrowing the scope of the WQL query to return CIM
instances according to the following rule: The only CIM instances returned are the
instances of the class CLASS-NAME and all the subclasses in CLASS-NAME's class
inheritance hierarchy.

__CLASS

A keyword referring to the CIM object, indicating the class of the current CIM object.
The __CLASS keyword in a WHERE clause only selects CIM instances of derived classes
made out of the CLASS-NAME.

Schema objects and
keywords

Description

ASSOCIATORS OF

OPTIONAL-ASSOC-
WHERE

 A keyword that is a WQL statement to locate associated CIM classes or CIM
instances. It MUST NOT be used in combination with the SELECT keyword and the
REFERENCES OF keyword.

If the WHERE statement is specified in an ASSOCIATORS OF WQL query, it narrows the
scope to one or several characteristics of the association and associated CIM classes.
The filter expression can be made of several specific keywords and expressions to
validate these characteristics. Each expression MUST be separated by a BLANK
character, as specified in the preceding ABNF notation. Each expression MUST NOT be
used more than once in a single WQL query. The keyword supported to narrow the
scope of an ASSOCIATORS OF query are AssocClass, RequiredAssocQualifier,
RequiredQualifier, ResultClass, ResultRole, Role, KeysOnly, and ClassDefsOnly.

REFERENCES OF

A keyword that is a WQL statement to locate the CIM classes or CIM instances
associating CIM classes or CIM instances. It MUST NOT be used in combination with
the SELECT keyword and the ASSOCIATORS OF keyword.

OPTIONAL-REF-WHERE

If the WHERE statement is specified in a REFERENCES OF query, it narrows the scope
to one or several characteristics of the association and associated classes. The filter
expression can be made of several specific keywords and expressions to express these
characteristics. Each expression MUST be separated by a BLANK character. Each
expression MUST NOT be used more than once in a single WQL query. The keywords
supported to narrow the scope of a REFERENCES OF query are RequiredQualifier,
ResultClass, Role, KeysOnly, and ClassDefsOnly.

OBJECT-REL-PATH

The CIM relative path of the CIM class or CIM instance to be queried. It MUST be
specified for ASSOCIATORS OF and REFERENCES OF queries.

KeysOnly

ClassDefsOnly

AssocClass

RequiredAssocQualifier

If the KeysOnly keyword is being used in ASSOCIATORS OF and REFERENCES OF
queries, only the key properties of resulting CIM instances MUST be populated.

If the ClassDefsOnly keyword is being used in ASSOCIATORS OF and REFERENCES OF
queries only the CIM class definitions of resulting CIM instances MUST be returned.

If the AssocClass keyword is being used in ASSOCIATORS OF queries, the resulting
CIM instances MUST be associated with association class or CIM instances made out of
the CLASS-NAME specified.

If the RequiredAssocQualifier keyword is being used in ASSOCIATORS OF queries, the
returned CIM instances is associated with the source object through an association
class that included the specified qualifier. For example, in the following query:
ASSOCIATORS OF {Win32_LogicalDisk.DeviceID="C:"} WHERE
RequiredAssocQualifier = Association

the returned CIM instances is associated with the source object represented by
{Win32_LogicalDisk.DeviceID="C:"} through an association class that includes the
qualifier "association".

RequiredQualifier

If the RequiredQualifier keyword is being used in ASSOCIATORS OF and REFERENCES

HAVING

BY

The WHERE statement narrows the scope of a SELECT event query if the EVENT-CLASS-NAME is
an extrinsic or timer event CIM class. The WHERE statement MUST be specified to narrow the
scope of a SELECT event query if the EVENT-CLASS-NAME is an intrinsic CIM class.

Indicates the type of instance to be evaluated. INSTANCE-STATE MUST be specified if CLASS-
NAME is an intrinsic CIM class. INSTANCE-STATE is optional if CLASS-NAME is an extrinsic CIM
class. If specified, INSTANCE-STATE MUST be PREVIOUSINSTANCE (to indicate that the state of
the CIM class or CIM instance before the event MUST be evaluated) or TARGETINSTANCE (to
indicate that the state of the CIM class or CIM instance after the event MUST be evaluated).

A keyword that MUST be used in combination with the INSTANCE-STATE keyword. It is used as a
comparative operator between the INSTANCE-STATE and a CLASS-NAME to reduce the scope of
events returned to the CIM instances made out of the CLASS-NAME.

If the GROUP WITHIN keyword is used, the INTERVAL MUST be specified. This keyword indicates
that all events occurring during the WITHIN INTERVAL period MUST be grouped as one event.

If the HAVING keyword is specified, it MUST be followed by EXPR to filter the selection of events.
This keyword indicates that all events grouped during the GROUP WITHIN period MUST meet the
expression specified in EXPR before being returned as one event.

A keyword that groups event instances sharing a same value on a specified PROPERTY-NAME. In
such a case, events are returned that represent a group of events sharing the same PROPERTY-
NAME value. The system MUST return as many events representing a group of events as there
are PROPERTY-NAME values.

EVENT-EXPR

 An expression for filtering WMI events.

#### 2.2.3 Protocol Return Codes

Codes that are returned by the protocol are represented as an HRESULT, as specified in [MS-ERREF]
section 2.1.

The HRESULT values that are documented in the following table are interpreted by the protocol
through a specific set of interface methods, as specified in sections 3.1.4.3, 3.1.4.4.2, and 3.2.4.1.1.

Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


The severity bit of HRESULT MUST be interpreted as specified in [MS-ERREF] section 2.1. HRESULT
errors are not recoverable by the protocol. HRESULT successes, other than the ones specified in the
following table, MUST be considered as equal to WBEM_S_NO_ERROR.

Constant/value

Description

WBEM_S_NO_ERROR

The operation was successful.

0x00000000

WBEM_S_FALSE

0x00000001

Either no more CIM objects are available, the number of returned CIM objects is less
than the number requested, or this is the end of an enumeration.

WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT

A call timed out. This is not an error condition.

0x00040004

WBEM_S_NEW_STYLE

0x000400FF

The operation was successful and indicates that the receiver of the call is able to receive
optimized IWbemObjectSink::Indicate calls.

#### 2.2.4 IWbemClassObject Interface

The signatures of many methods that are related to the Windows Management Instrumentation
Remote Protocol include a parameter to specify an IWbemClassObject interface pointer. This
parameter MUST be custom marshaled by the DCOM Remote Protocol, as specified in the following
table. The IWbemClassObject interface represents a WMI object, such as a WMI class or an object
instance. All CIM objects (CIM classes and CIM instances) that are passed during WMI calls
between the client and server are objects of this interface.

Parameter/source

Value/description

Interface UUID

{DC12A681-737F-11CF-884D-00AA004B2E24}

Marshaling buffer
layout

The buffer representing a CIM object MUST be encoded using the EncodingUnit object
block, as specified in [MS-WMIO] section 2.2.1.

Unmarshaler CLSID

{4590F812-1D3A-11D0-891F-00AA004B2E24}

This CLSID MUST represent the unmarshaler CLSID that is supplied by WMI to DCOM
and MUST be sent over the network by DCOM when custom marshaling is implemented.
For more information (OBJREF_CUSTOM), see the [MS-DCOM].

##### 2.2.4.1 Prototype Result Object

The prototype result object is an IWbemClassObject (section 2.2.4) that is returned when the lFlags
parameter of the IWbemServices::ExecQuery (section 3.1.4.3.18) or
IWbemServices::ExecQueryAsync (section 3.1.4.3.19) method includes the WBEM_FLAG_PROTOTYPE
flag.

The query returns the CIM class object that is specified in the CLASS-NAME of the query that is
modified to match the query.

If the query specifies PROPERTY-LIST, as specified in section 2.2.1.1, the class object is modified to
represent the results of the query by removing all the properties that are not specified in the
PROPERTY-LIST of the query and by adding selected properties with the Order qualifier (see the
2nd paragraph following concerning the Order qualifier). In this case, the CIM class is encoded as an
IWbemClassObject object, with an ObjectFlags block that contains a 0x10 value that is set as specified

28 / 234

[MS-WMI] - v20240423
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


in [MS-WMIO] section 2.2.6. If any key property is removed because it is not specified in PROPERTY-
LIST, the 0x40 flag is set on ObjectFlags.

If the query specifies ASTERISK, as specified in section 2.2.1.1, the class object is returned with all
the properties added to the Order qualifier. In this case, the CIM class is encoded as an
IWbemClassObject object and the 0x10 flag is not set in ObjectFlags.

The Order qualifier (QUALIFIER-NAME attribute set to Order, see section 2.2.1.1) is an array of 32-
bit signed integers. Each value in the array represents the position of the property in PROPERTY-
LIST (if PROPERTY-LIST is specified) or represents the order in which the property appears in the
class (if the query specifies ASTERISK). The position is encoded starting from 0.

For example,

 select prop1,prop2,prop1 from class1

results in class1 containing only two properties, prop1 and prop2. The prop1 property is added to an
Order qualifier that has a value of {0,2}, and the prop2 property is added to an Order qualifier that
has a value of {1}.

Note  The prop1 property occurs twice in the PROPERTY-LIST, at positions 1 and 3, and therefore,
has two values {0,2}.

If the query specifies a PROPERTY-LIST that does not contain at least one of the following
properties, the DerivationList in ClassPart of the CurrentClass, as specified in [MS-WMIO] section
2.2.17, is encoded as empty:

  __DERIVATION

  __SUPERCLASS

  __DYNASTY

Otherwise, the DerivationList in ClassPart of the CurrentClass is encoded in the same way as the
actual CIM class that represents the CLASS-NAME of the query.

The PropertyLookupTable, NdTable, ValueTable, and ClassHeap in ClassPart of the CurrentClass (as
specified in [MS-WMIO] section 2.2.15) are encoded to contain only the selected properties in the
query.

Remaining items are encoded in the same way as the CIM class that represents the CLASS-NAME
that is specified in the query.

##### 2.2.4.2 Extrinsic Events

Extrinsic events are events generated by a component outside the implementation. In WMI, extrinsic
events are represented as instances of a class that is derived from the __ExtrinsicEvent class. If any
component wants to generate an event, the component defines a class that is derived from the
__ExtrinsicEvent class. Instances of the derived class defined by the component, represented by using
IWbemClassObject (section 2.2.4), are used to send events.

__ExtrinsicEvent class is defined by WMI as shown in the following MOF text.

 [abstract]
 class __SystemClass
 {
 };

 {
 };

  [abstract: DisableOverride ToInstance ToSubClass]
 class __Event : __IndicationRelated
 {
     uint64 TIME_CREATED;
     uint8 SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR[];
 };

 class __ExtrinsicEvent : __Event
 {
 };

Where TIME_CREATED is the time at which the event is generated, represented as a 64-bit value that
represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601 (UTC), and
SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR is a security descriptor, as defined in [MS-DTYP], represented as an array of
bytes. The security descriptor MUST specify security for events as specified in section 5.2.

#### 2.2.5 WBEM_CHANGE_FLAG_TYPE Enumeration

The WBEM_CHANGE_FLAG_TYPE enumeration is used to indicate and update the type of the flag.

 typedef [v1_enum] enum tag_WBEM_CHANGE_FLAG_TYPE
 {
   WBEM_FLAG_CREATE_OR_UPDATE = 0x00,
   WBEM_FLAG_UPDATE_ONLY = 0x01,
   WBEM_FLAG_CREATE_ONLY = 0x02,
   WBEM_FLAG_UPDATE_SAFE_MODE = 0x20,
   WBEM_FLAG_UPDATE_FORCE_MODE = 0x40
 } WBEM_CHANGE_FLAG_TYPE;

WBEM_FLAG_CREATE_OR_UPDATE:  This flag causes the put operation to update the class or

instance if it does not exist, or to overwrite the class or instance if it exists already.

WBEM_FLAG_UPDATE_ONLY:  This flag causes the put operation to update the class or instance.

The class or instance MUST exist for the call to be successful.

WBEM_FLAG_CREATE_ONLY:  This flag causes the put operation to create the class or instance. For

the call to be successful, the class or instance MUST NOT exist.

WBEM_FLAG_UPDATE_SAFE_MODE:  This flag allows updates of classes even if there are child

classes, as long as the change does not cause any conflicts with child classes. An example of an
update that this flag allows is the adding of a new property to the base class that was not
previously mentioned in any of the child classes. If the class has instances, the update fails.

WBEM_FLAG_UPDATE_FORCE_MODE:  This flag forces updates of classes when conflicting child

classes exist. An example of an update that this flag forces is when a class qualifier is defined in a
child class and the base class tries to add the same qualifier that conflicted with the existing one.
In force mode, this conflict is resolved by deleting the conflicting qualifier in the child class.

#### 2.2.6 WBEM_GENERIC_FLAG_TYPE Enumeration

The WBEM_GENERIC_FLAG_TYPE enumeration is used to indicate and update the type of the flag.

   WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS = 0x20000,
   WBEM_FLAG_STRONG_VALIDATION = 0x100000
 } WBEM_GENERIC_FLAG_TYPE;

WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_WBEM_COMPLETE:  This flag makes the operation synchronous. This is the

default behavior and so this flag need not be explicitly specified.

WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY:  This flag causes the call to return without waiting for the

operation to complete. The call result parameter contains the IWbemCallResult object by using the
status of the operation that can be retrieved.

WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY:  This flag causes a forward-only enumerator,

IEnumWbemClassObject, (section 3.1.4.4), to be returned. Forward-only enumerators are
typically much faster and use less memory than conventional enumerators; however, they do not
allow calls to IEnumWbemClassObject::Clone or IEnumWbemClassObject::Reset.

WBEM_FLAG_NO_ERROR_OBJECT:  This flag MUST NOT be set, and MUST be ignored on receipt.

WBEM_FLAG_SEND_STATUS:  This flag registers a request with WMI to receive intermediate status
reports through the client implementation of IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus, if supported by the
server implementation.

WBEM_FLAG_ENSURE_LOCATABLE:  This flag ensures that any returned objects have enough

information in them so that system properties, such as __PATH, __RELPATH, and __SERVER,<1>
are non-NULL.

WBEM_FLAG_DIRECT_READ:  This flag causes direct access to the specified class without regard to

its parent class or subclasses.

WBEM_MASK_RESERVED_FLAGS:  This flag MUST NOT be set, and MUST be ignored on receipt.

WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS:  If this flag is set, the server retrieves any qualifiers
in the CIM object that can be localized in the current connection's locale. The set of localized
qualifiers and the list of locales for which the qualifier is localized are implementation dependent.
When the localized information is available, the server retrieves the localized values using the
client-preferred locale. If the localized values are not available, the server returns values using the
default locale.

The localized qualifiers or amended qualifiers are identified by the qualifier flavor as defined in
[MS-WMIO] section 2.2.62.

If this flag is not set, the server does not retrieve any localized qualifiers for the CIM object.

WBEM_FLAG_STRONG_VALIDATION:  This flag MUST NOT be set, and MUST be ignored on

receipt.

#### 2.2.7 WBEM_STATUS_TYPE Enumeration

The WBEM_STATUS_TYPE enumeration gives information about the status of the operation.

 {
   WBEM_STATUS_COMPLETE = 0,
   WBEM_STATUS_REQUIREMENTS = 0x01,
   WBEM_STATUS_PROGRESS = 2
 } WBEM_STATUS_TYPE;

WBEM_STATUS_COMPLETE:  When the WMI operation is completed, WMI calls

IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus with WBEM_STATUS_COMPLETE.

WBEM_STATUS_REQUIREMENTS:  This flag MUST NOT be set, and MUST be ignored on receipt.

WBEM_STATUS_PROGRESS:  WMI reports the progress of the operation to
IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus with flag WBEM_STATUS_PROGRESS.

#### 2.2.8 WBEM_TIMEOUT_TYPE Enumeration

The WBEM_TIMEOUT_TYPE enumeration gives information about the type of time-out for the process.

 typedef [v1_enum] enum tag_WBEM_TIMEOUT_TYPE
 {
   WBEM_NO_WAIT = 0,
   WBEM_INFINITE = 0xFFFFFFFF
 } WBEM_TIMEOUT_TYPE;

WBEM_NO_WAIT:  If passed as a time-out parameter to the IEnumWbemClassObject::Next method,
the call returns the available objects, if any, at the time of the call; it does not wait for any more
objects.

WBEM_INFINITE:  If passed as a time-out parameter to IEnumWbemClassObject::Next, the call

blocks until objects are available.

#### 2.2.9 WBEM_QUERY_FLAG_TYPE Enumeration

The WBEM_QUERY_FLAG_TYPE enumeration gives information about the type of the flag.

 typedef [v1_enum] enum tag_WBEM_QUERY_FLAG_TYPE
 {
   WBEM_FLAG_DEEP = 0,
   WBEM_FLAG_SHALLOW = 1,
   WBEM_FLAG_PROTOTYPE = 2
 } WBEM_QUERY_FLAG_TYPE;

WBEM_FLAG_DEEP:  If used in IWbemServices::CreateClassEnum or

IWbemServices::CreateClassEnumAsync, the WBEM_FLAG_DEEP constant causes the enumeration
to return all the subclasses in the hierarchy of a specified class but to not return the class itself.

If used in IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnum or IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnumAsync,
this constant causes the enumeration to return the instances of this class and also the instances of
subclasses in the hierarchy of the class.

WBEM_FLAG_SHALLOW:  If used in IWbemServices::CreateClassEnum or

IWbemServices::CreateClassEnumAsync, the WBEM_FLAG_SHALLOW constant causes the
enumeration to return the immediate subclasses of a specified class.

[MS-WMI] - v20240423

Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

32 / 234


If used in IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnum or IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnumAsync,
this constant causes the enumeration to return only the instances of this class and excludes all
instances of subclasses.

WBEM_FLAG_PROTOTYPE:  This flag is used for prototyping. It does not run the query; instead, it

returns the Prototype Result Object as specified in section 2.2.4.1.

#### 2.2.10 WBEM_BACKUP_RESTORE_FLAGS Enumeration

The WBEM_BACKUP_RESTORE_FLAGS enumeration gives information about the backup and restore

#### 2.2.11 WBEMSTATUS Enumeration

The WBEMSTATUS enumeration gives information about the status of an operation. If the server
encounters an error condition for which this protocol does not explicitly state an error value, the
server can return any HRESULT to indicate failure by setting the Severity (S bit) of the HRESULT, as
defined in [MS-ERREF] section 2.1.

The statuses of operations that are not explicitly called out in this document but are part of the
associated IDL are deemed to be local-only and are implementation-specific.

All scalar types that are encountered in the following structures MUST be stored in little-endian
format.

The IWbemContext interface is marshaled or unmarshaled by using the following data structures.

Structure

Description

IWbemContextBuffer Marshaling

Structure requirements for marshaling a buffer.

IWbemContextProperty Marshaling  Structure requirements for marshaling a property.

IWbemContextString Marshaling

Structure requirements for marshaling a string.

IWbemContextArray Marshaling

Structure requirements for marshaling an array.

The IWbemContext interface pointer is specified as a parameter for many remote methods in WMI.
The data structures that are listed here define the wire formats for the data that is used by this
protocol.

The integer formats OCTET, UINT16, and UINT32 are encoded as defined in [MS-WMIO] section
2.2.72.

##### 2.2.13.1 IWbemContextBuffer Marshaling Structure



The IWbemContextBuffer data structure defines the wire format for buffer data that is used by this
protocol. Its structure has the following encoding format (defined in ABNF notation as specified in
[RFC4234]).

 IWbemContextBuffer = NumGuids *GUID NumProps *IWbemContextProperty



The stream MUST start with a 32-bit integer (NumGUIDs, in the following list). The following
ABNF represents the number of GUIDs that are present in the next GuidArray. GUID is defined in
[MS-DTYP] section 2.3.4.

 NumGuids = UINT32

  NumGuids MUST be set to 1, MUST be followed by an array of standard GUIDs, and MUST

contain NumGuids elements. Since the NumGuids value is set to 1, only one GUID needs to be
present.



The stream MUST contain a 32-bit integer that represents the property count.

 NumProps = UINT32



The property list MUST immediately follow the property count and MUST be marshaled as a
continuous list without padding between properties, as specified in
IWbemContextProperty (section 2.2.13.2). The number of IWbemContextProperty properties
MUST be equal to NumProps.

##### 2.2.13.2 IWbemContextProperty Marshaling Structure



The IWbemContextProperty data structure defines the wire format for property data that is used by
this protocol. The property is a variable-length structure and has the following structure:

[MS-WMI] - v20240423
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

39 / 234


 IWbemContextProperty = PropertyName PropertyFlags PropertyType PropertyValue

  PropertyName MUST be the name of the property, marshaled as a string in the

IWbemContextString format specified in 2.2.13.3.

 PropertyName = IWbemContextString

  PropertyFlags is a 32-bit integer. It MUST be set to 0 and ignored.

 PropertyFlags = UINT32

  PropertyType is a 16-bit unsigned integer that represents the type of the property.

 PropertyType = UINT16

MUST have one of the following values as specified in [MS-OAUT] section 2.2.7:

  VT_NULL

  VT_I2

  VT_I4

  VT_R4

  VT_R8

  VT_BSTR

  VT_BOOL

  VT_UI1

  VT_UI2

  VT_UI4

  VT_UNKNOWN

  VT_I1

If the value is an array, the listed property types MUST be combined by using the bitwise OR
operation with VT_ARRAY (also specified in [MS-OAUT] section 2.2.7).

  PropertyValue is marshaled as shown in the following table.

 Property types

VT_R8

MUST be marshaled in an 8-byte floating-point format as specified in [IEEE754].

VT_ARRAY | VT_*

MUST be marshaled as an IWbemContextArray structure, as specified in 2.2.13.4.

##### 2.2.13.3 IWbemContextString Marshaling Structure



The IWbemContextString data structure defines the wire format for the string data that is used by this
protocol. Strings (property names and VT_BSTR properties values) MUST be represented as a 32-bit
character count and followed by a sequence of characters that are encoded in UTF-16, as specified in
[UNICODE].

IWbemContextString has the following structure.

 IWbemContextString = StringLength *UnicodeCharacter

  StringLength MUST represent the length of the string as a character count.

 StringLength = UINT32
 UnicodeCharacter = 2OCTET

  StringLength MUST be followed by a sequence of characters encoded with UTF-16, as specified in

[UNICODE]. The length of the sequence MUST be equal to StringLength. The string MUST NOT
have a terminating NIL (0x0000) character.

##### 2.2.13.4 IWbemContextArray Marshaling Structure



The IWbemContextArray data structure defines the wire format for array data that is used by this
protocol. IWbemContextArray has the following structure:

 IWbemContextArray = ElementCount ElementSize *Elements

  ElementCount MUST be an integer that represents the number of elements in the array.

ElementCount = UINT32.

  ElementSize MUST represent the size of a single element in the array. The size MUST match the

size of the elements. ElementSize = UINT32.

  Elements is a variable stream of bytes that represent all element values in the array. (Array

elements are marshaled in a different representation from nonarray elements.)

Each element MUST be marshaled as an array of bytes that use the following representation.

MUST be marshaled as an IWbemContextString. In this case, ElementSize SHOULD be
set to 4 or 8.<4>

VT_IUNKNOWN

MUST be marshaled as an array of bytes that represent a marshaling buffer for the
IWbemClassObject interface. In this case, ElementSize SHOULD be set to 4 or 8.<5>

VT_NULL

MUST be marshaled as 0 bytes.

VT_I1, VT_UI1

MUST be marshaled as 1 byte.

VT_I4, VT_UI4

MUST be marshaled in 4-byte little-endian format.

VT_R4

 MUST be marshaled as an array of 8 bytes with the first 4 bytes containing the value of
the property, as specified in [IEEE754], in a 4-byte floating-point format.

VT_R8

MUST be marshaled as an 8-byte floating-point format, as specified in [IEEE754].

VT_I2, VT_BOOL,
VT_UI2

MUST be marshaled as a 2-byte little-endian format.

#### 2.2.14 ObjectArray Structure

The ObjectArray structure MUST be used to encode multiple CIM objects that are returned in
response to the IWbemWCOSmartEnum::Next (section 3.1.4.7.1) method. This structure is also used
to encode parameters of the optimized IWbemObjectSink::Indicate (section 3.1.4.2.1) method.<6>
To minimize network bandwidth, a server SHOULD support the ObjectArray structure when an array of
CIM objects is sent.

The optimization MUST be achieved by sending the CIM class information just once at the beginning
of the communication for the same class type. Instances of different classes are allowed, in which case
only the first instance of every unique class MUST contain the CIM class information for optimization.
This CIM class MUST be identified by a randomly generated GUID, generated by the server, that that
is maintained by both the server and the client for the duration of the method call. The remaining CIM
instances MUST be sent without the CIM class information. The CIM class definition that is identified
by the GUID is used to reconstruct the full CIM instances on the client side.

sd: Exchanges a byte array containing a self-relative SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR structure, as defined in

[MS-DTYP] (section 2.4.6).

A return value of 0 indicates success. Any nonzero value indicates failure.<8>

##### 2.2.30.2 __SystemSecurity::SetSD



The SetSD method changes the security descriptor in the NamespaceConnection of the namespace. If
there is a parent namespace, server MUST add access control entries of the parent to the security
descriptor using the following rules.

If the Discretionary Access Control List of the parent security descriptor is not protected, meaning that
if the SE_DACL_PROTECTED bit is not set in the parent security descriptor, then execute the following
algorithm using the DACL of the parent and child security descriptors.

If the System Access Control List of the parent security descriptor is not protected, meaning that if the
SE_SACL_PROTECTED bit is not set in the parent security descriptor, then execute the following
algorithm using the SACL of the parent and child security descriptors.

1.  For each Access Control Entry of parent ACL, if CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE bit is not set, then

ignore this ACE.

2.  Otherwise, append the parent ACE to the ACL in the child security descriptor. If

NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT_ACE bit is set in the parent ACE, server MUST clear the
CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE bit from the appended ACE.

3.  If INHERIT_ONLY_ACE bit is set in the parent ACE, server MUST clear this bit from the appended

ACE.

This method is called using IWbemServices interface as described in section 3.2.4.2.5.

 void SetSD (
   [out] Uint32 sd
 );

sd: Exchanges a byte array containing a self-relative SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR structure, as defined in

[MS-DTYP] (section 2.4.6).

A return value of 0 indicates success. Any nonzero value indicates failure.<9>

##### 2.2.30.3 RequiresEncryption



The RequiresEncryption qualifier has a Boolean data type. If the RequiresEncryption qualifier is
present and set to TRUE for the __SystemSecurity singleton instance, the server SHOULD set the
RequiresEncryption flag for the containing CIM namespace. If RequiresEncryption is set, the
server MUST reject the client request with authentication levels that are not equal to
RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY.<10>

#### 2.2.31 Default System Classes

Classes whose names begin with an underscore are termed system classes. WMI defines certain
system classes as listed as below. MOF representation of each of the class objects can be obtained by
using the script specified in Appendix D: Enumerating Class Schema.

__SystemClass: Base class from which for all of the system classes below.

## 3 Protocol Details

The following sections specify details of the Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol,
including abstract data models, interface method syntax, and message processing rules. A client in the
context of this specification is a machine that issues a Windows Management Instrumentation Remote
Protocol request. The request is issued against a Windows Management Instrumentation Remote
Protocol server. In this context, a server is a machine that handles the request issued by the client.
Detailed sequence diagrams are as specified in section 4.

### 3.1 Server Details

A client in the context of this specification is a machine that issues a Windows Management
Instrumentation Remote Protocol request. The request is issued against a Windows Management
Instrumentation Remote Protocol server. In this context, a server is a machine that handles the
request issued by the client. Detailed sequence diagrams are as specified in section 4. However, an
overview of a typical protocol sequence is illustrated as follows.

definition. If the instances are returned from the CIM database rather than a provider, this
value MUST be set to NULL.

ClassInstancesTable: A list of instances of the given CIM class.

The ClassTable MUST include entries defining the system classes in sections 2.2.30 and 2.2.31. If the
server supports the dynamic objects, the server MUST maintain a ProviderTable in the CIM database
where each entry contains:

ProviderId: Unique Id of the provider in the system.

ProviderEntryPoint: A pointer to the provider instance that the server is to communicate with.

IsClassProvider: A Boolean that is true if the provider creates dynamic CIM classes, or false if it only

creates dynamic instances.

ProviderArchitectureType: The provider architecture, either 32-bit or 64-bit. ProviderId is the

same for each ProviderArchitectureType value. ProviderId and ProviderArchitectureType
uniquely determine the ProviderEntryPoint to be used to forward the calls to a given provider in
the system.

SupportsGet: A Boolean value that is TRUE if the abstract interface Get Properties within an Instance
of a Class (section 3.1.4.17.3) or Get Properties within a Class (section 3.1.4.17.4) is supported
by the provider. By default, this value is set to FALSE.

in progress. Each entry of this table corresponds to one asynchronous call, where each entry
contains the following:

ClientSyncPointer: A pointer to IWbemObjectSink passed as a response handler by the client
as part of an asynchronous call. This can be used to identify a client asynchronous call on the
server.

CallbackInProgress: A Boolean value that is set to TRUE if there is an

IWbemObjectSink::Indicate or IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus with a currently-in-progress
message. The value is set to FALSE if there is no IWbemObjectSink::Indicate and
IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus in progress for the operation. See sections 3.2.4.1.1 and
###### 3.2.4.1.2 for more details.

CallCancelled: A Boolean value that is set to TRUE if the operation is canceled. The initial value of

this variable is FALSE.

SetStatusWithFinalResultCalled: A Boolean value that is set to TRUE if

IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus with a final result is called. The initial value of this variable is
FALSE.

WbemCallResultTable: A table to store information about pending single-result semisynchronous

operations (see section 3.2.4.2.7 for a list of single-result semisynchronous operations). Each
entry in this table corresponds to one semisynchronous call, where each entry contains the
following:

WbemCallResultPointer: A pointer to a server-created IWbemCallResult object.

FinalResult: An HRESULT to store the result status of the call.

The following ADM elements are used to store information about semisynchronous calls returning
multiple objects (see section 3.2.4.2.8 for a list of multiple-result semisynchronous calls).

SemiSinkResultSetObject: A structure to store the results of multiple-result semisynchronous calls.

One instance of this structure is created for every multiple-result semisynchronous call. The
structure contains the following:

ResultArray: An array of IWbemClassObjects to store the result objects.

CurrentTotalCount: An integer value to store the count of the valid number of array elements.

OperationFinished: A Boolean value to store if the operation is completed. This value is initially

set to FALSE.

RefCount: An integer indicating the count of IEnumWbemClassObject pointers that point to this

instance of SemiSinkResultObject. When this count becomes zero, the object is freed.

Flags: The lFlags parameter value passed in as part of a semisynchronous call.

FinalResult: An HRESULT to store the result status of the call.

ClientSecurityContext: The security context of the client.

EnumWbemClassObjectTable: A table to store information about the pending result of

semisynchronous operations. Each entry in this table either corresponds to one semisynchronous
call or is a clone of another IEnumWbemClassObject instance. Each entry contains the following:

EnumWbemClassObjectPointer: A pointer to SemiSinkResultSetObject.

ResultSetPointer: A pointer to SemiSinkResultSetObject.

CurrentIndex: An integer value pointing to the index of the next object to be given to the client.

SinkQueue: A queue to store the information about pending NextAsync calls. Each element of this

queue contains the following:

RemainingRequestCount: An integer representing the remaining number of objects to be given

as part of the callbacks on this sink.

3.1.1.1  Delivering Results to Client

3.1.1.1.1 Synchronous Calls

The server MUST complete the requested operation before returning from the synchronous method
call. The status of the operation is returned as return value of the method. On successful execution of
the synchronous methods, the server MUST return result object or objects in the out parameter of the
method.

3.1.1.1.2 Semisynchronous Calls

The server MUST start the requested operation and MUST return the appropriate response without
waiting for the operation to complete. If the requested operation fails to start, the server MUST return
an error as a return value of the method and MUST NOT return IEnumWbemClassObject or
IWbemCallResult as an out parameter.

3.1.1.1.2.1  Semisynchronous Operations Returning Multiple Objects

[MS-WMI] - v20240423
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

61 / 234


For the requested operation to begin successfully, the server MUST create and return an object of type
IEnumWbemClassObject for the following methods, and the return value MUST be
WBEM_S_NO_ERROR, as specified in section 2.2.11. When the client calls the methods of
IEnumWbemClassObject, the IEnumWbemClassObject method MUST deliver the results of the
requested operation. The enumeration of IEnumWbemClassObject MUST return the same result set as
the corresponding synchronous operation.

Before returning WBEM_S_NO_ERROR, the server MUST create an instance of the
SemiSinkResultSetObject ADM element and initialize CurrentTotalCount to zero, OperationFinished
to FALSE, and RefCount to 1. The server MUST also copy the lFlags parameter of the operation. The
server MUST create an entry in EnumWbemClassObjectTable for IEnumWbemClassObject by
storing a pointer to SemiSinkResultSetObject created for this operation in ResultSetPointer. The
server initializes CurrentIndex of EnumWbemClassObjectTable to start the index of ResultArray
and stores the security context of the client in ClientSecurityContext.

IWbemServices::CreateClassEnum (section 3.1.4.3.10)

IWbemServices::ExecNotificationQuery (section 3.1.4.3.20)

The server stores the results of the operation in SemiSinkResultSetObject and tracks the client
fetching the results by using the entry in EnumWbemClassObjectTable.

The server updates the SemiSinkResultSetObject EnumWbemClassObjectTable entry as follows:

1.  The server MUST store the results of the operation in ResultArray as they are available and

update CurrentTotalCount to reflect the total results.

2.  The server MUST set OperationFinished to TRUE when the operation is finished.

3.  When the operation is finished, either completed or failed, the server MUST set FinalResult with

the result code as specified in section 2.2.11 and set OperationFinished to TRUE.

4.  When the client releases the reference to IEnumWbemClassObject, the server MUST delete the

EnumWbemClassObjectTable entry and decrement RefCount by 1 for the
SemiSinkResultSetObject referenced in ResultSetPointer.

5.  When the RefCount of SemiSinkResultSetObject is zero, the server MUST free the result stored

in ResultArray and delete this instance of SemiSinkResultSetObject.

3.1.1.1.2.2  Semisynchronous Operations Returning a Single Object

If the requested operation begins successfully, the server MUST return an IWbemCallResult object for
the following methods, and the return value MUST be WBEM_S_NO_ERROR. When the client calls the
methods of IWbemCallResult, IWbemCallResult MUST deliver the result of the requested operation.

Before returning WBEM_S_NO_ERROR, the server MUST create an entry in WbemCallResultTable by
keeping a reference to IEnumWbemClassObject in WbemCallResultPointer and initializing
ResultObject, ResultString, and ResultService to NULL. The server MUST set OperationFinished
to FALSE.

IWbemServices::DeleteClass (section 3.1.4.3.8)

IWbemServices::DeleteInstance (section 3.1.4.3.14)

IWbemServices::ExecMethod (section 3.1.4.3.22)

The server sets ResultObject, ResultString, and ResultService as the results become available for
the respective operations. When an operation is finished, the server MUST set FinalResult with the
operation result and set OperationFinished to TRUE. The server MUST remove the entry for this
operation from WbemCallResultTable when the client releases its last reference of
IEnumWbemClassObject.

3.1.1.1.3 Asynchronous calls

The server MUST start the requested operation and MUST return the appropriate response without
waiting for the completion of the operation. If starting the requested operation fails, the server MUST
return the error as a return value of the method; MUST NOT keep a reference to IWbemObjectSink
(passed as a response handler); and MUST NOT call IWbemObjectSink::Indicate or
IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus.

Section 3.2.4.2.9 lists the asynchronous method calls. Before starting an asynchronous operation, the
server method MUST create an entry in AsyncOperationTable, storing a reference to the client's
IWbemObjectSink in ClientSyncPointer, and set other fields (CallbackInprogress, CallCancelled,
and SetStatusWithFinalResultCalled) to FALSE.

For the requested operation to begin successfully, the server MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR, as
specified in section 2.2.11 and MUST keep a reference to IWbemObjectSink passed as a response
handler.

The server MUST invoke the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate and IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus methods,
as specified in sections 3.2.4.1.1 and 3.2.4.1.2. If the call to IWbemObjectSink::Indicate or
IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus fails, the server MUST cancel the asynchronous operation.

The server MAY call IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus multiple times when it executes the asynchronous
operation in order to report the operation progress,<15> as explicitly requested by a client using a
WBEM_SEND_STATUS flag. In this situation, the HRESULT parameter contains the progress
information.

Calls made by the server into the client-provided IWbemObjectSink interface SHOULD use an
authentication level that is greater than NONE. If that fails, and if the
UnsecAppAccessControlDefault flag is set to false and AllowAnonymousCallback flag is set to
true, the server SHOULD retry with an authentication level of NONE.<16> The server MUST try to
make the calls by using the machine principal name.

The total number of client operations is limited by MaxRequestLimit as described in section 3.1.4.3.

3.1.1.2  Localization Support

The server MUST support storage of CIM localizable information. The localizable class properties
MUST have amended qualifiers in the MOF class definition.

The server MUST store each class with amended qualifiers as two or more objects:

  A locale-neutral object that contains all properties, with all amended qualifiers stripped.

  A localized object for each supported locale. The class object contains only the properties that

have amended qualifiers, and their respective qualifiers. This localized object MUST be stored in
a namespace that is a direct child of the namespace (from NamespaceConnectionTable) in

[MS-WMI] - v20240423
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

63 / 234


which a locale-neutral object exists and the name of the namespace MUST be a locale name in the
"MS_xxx" format (see section 2.2.29).

When the server updates an existing class, it MUST observe the
WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS flag:





If the client specifies the flag, then both locale-neutral and locale-specific objects MUST be
updated.

If the client does not specify the flag, only the locale-neutral object MUST be updated. If the class
sent by the client contains amended qualifiers, then the server MUST update the locale-neutral
class exactly as requested, rather than removing the amended qualifiers.

When the client creates a new class, the server MUST create the class only in the locale-neutral area
(regardless whether WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS is set). The amended qualifiers
MUST not be stripped.

When the client retrieves a class object and the WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS is set,
the server MUST merge the locale-neutral and locale-dependent class definitions and present them as
one class to the client using the following algorithm.

  Retrieve the locale-neutral class. Then it MUST search for localized class objects, using the list of

locales in the NamespaceConnection object's ClientPreferredLocales. The search for the class
is made in the order of the locales in ClientPreferredLocales. When the requested class is found
in one locale namespace, the server MUST stop looking.



If present, the localized object MUST be merged with the neutral object (which has priority over
any qualifier present in the localized object).

When a client retrieves a class object and the WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS flag is
not set, the server MUST return the locale-neutral object as-is, without checking for localized
definitions. If the locale-neutral class is not found, the server MUST return WBEM_E_NOT_FOUND,
regardless of whether WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS is specified, even if locale-
specific objects exist.

Note  The class will have amended qualifiers if the class object was originally created without
stripping the amended qualifiers.

If a class is annotated with the Amendment qualifier, attempts to create instances of the class MUST
fail with a WBEM_E_INVALID_OPERATION error.

When a client deletes a class object and the WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS flag is not
set, the server MUST delete the locale-neutral object as-is, without checking for localized definitions.

When a client deletes a class object and the WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS flag is
set, the server MUST fail with a WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER error.

3.1.2  Timers

The server MUST use timers to ensure that the conversation between itself and its clients remains
active. The Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol uses the following timers:

Sink timer: Each asynchronous operation has a corresponding timer, which MUST be initialized to
30 seconds when the server calls the client back using IWbemObjectSink. The timer MUST be
reset when the call completes.

Backup timer: Each IWbemBackupRestoreEx has a corresponding timer, which MUST be initialized to
15 minutes when the server receives an IWbemBackupRestoreEx::Pause. The timer MUST be
reset when the server receives an IWbemBackupRestoreEx::Resume.

EventPollingTimer: This timer tracks the polling interval specified by the WITHIN clause of an

event query. The timer interval is the number of seconds specified in the query. The minimum
value of the polling interval is 0.001 (equivalent to 1 millisecond) and the maximum value is
418937 (0xffffffff/1000).

EventGroupingTimer: This timer tracks the grouping interval specified by the GROUP WITHIN

clause of an event query. The timer interval is the number of seconds specified in the query. The
minimum value of the polling interval is 0.001 (equivalent to 1 millisecond) and the maximum
value is 418937 (0xffffffff/1000).

3.1.3  Initialization

The protocol MUST be initialized after successful activation of one of the two interfaces that are
registered with the DCOM Remote Protocol infrastructure, as specified in [MS-DCOM] section 1.9.

All the global flags and other elements mentioned in ADM are volatile unless they are loaded and
stored from CIM database. Unless otherwise specified, the updates to the ADM elements directly
happen in CIM database.

The server MUST initialize InitSuccess to false.

The server MUST initialize EventDropLimit to 1000.

The server MUST initialize MaxRequestLimit to 5000.

The server MUST initialize CurrentRequestCount to 0.

The server MUST initialize UnsecAppAccessControlDefault to false.

The server MUST enumerate the NamespaceConnectionTable and ensure that a single
__SystemSecurity instance is present in each namespace and matches the namespace's
RequiresEncryption flag and security descriptor.

If the server has dynamic CIM classes or CIM instances in the system, the server MUST load each
provider of the ProviderTable as described in 3.1.6.2.

The server MUST create an empty EventBindingTable object during its initialization. The information
kept in this object is volatile and is not persisted during the server's shutdown.

The server MUST initialize the BackupInProgress flag to False.

The server MUST initialize the RestoreInProgress flag to False.

The server MUST initialize the IsServerPaused flag to False.

The server MUST initialize the IsServerShuttingDown flag to False.

The server SHOULD initialize AllowAnonymousCallback to False. <17>

When the server has successfully initialized the above data structures, it MUST set InitSuccess to
True.

3.1.4  Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

The server MUST accept multiple parallel invocations from different clients running under different
security principals that the server impersonates. On each interface, the server MUST support
multiple outstanding calls.

Release: April 23, 2024

65 / 234


The errors returned by the server are not actionable unless explicitly specified in this section. The
server MUST perform an access check against all operations and ensure secure access to the results.
If the access check fails, the server MUST return WBEM_E_ACCESS_DENIED.

If the impersonation level is not RPC_C_IMPL_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE or
RPC_C_IMPL_LEVEL_DELEGATE, the server MUST return WBEM_E_ACCESS_DENIED.

The methods MUST be secured by using access rights as specified in section 5.2.

The server MUST treat characters as Unicode characters and represent them in 16 bits. This is
contrary to the requirement of [DMTF-DSP0004] where the string data type is interpreted as a UCS
character.

The server MAY support ordered array types, as specified in the requirement of [DMTF-
DSP0004].<18>

If the server detects that the IWbemClassObject that is sent by the client does not conform to [MS-
WMIO] encoding, as specified in section 2.2.4, the server MUST return an HRESULT that has the S
(severity) bit set as specified in [MS-ERREF]. The exact code is implementation-dependent.

If the server is expected to set the value of the output parameter, but the output parameter is set to
NULL upon input, the server SHOULD return an error to indicate failure. In this case, the server cannot
modify the output parameter.

For all methods, the server MUST enforce that the DCOM security level is at least at the
RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT level, and SHOULD be RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY; the
server MUST also evaluate the security principal rights to open a CIM namespace.<19> The server
MUST fail the operation if the security requirements are not met.

For all IwbemServices methods, the server MUST verify that the client has been granted the access
rights specified in the method description, by testing that those rights are included in
GrantedAccess.

For all methods, if the server cannot find the NamespaceConnection associated with IWbemServices
in the NamespaceConnectionTable (either because the table no longer contains a row for the
namespace or because the NamespaceConnection was replaced during
IWbemBackupRestore::Restore), the server MUST return WBEM_E_INVALID_NAMESPACE.

For all methods that create, query, update, or delete the CIM instances, the server MUST obtain
InstanceProviderId for the given class from the ClassTable.

If InstanceProviderId is NULL, the server MUST forward the request to the CIM database. If
InstanceProviderId is not NULL, and if the IWbemContext object is passed to the server, WMI MUST
obtain the ProviderArchitecture from the IWbemContext object, and use the following algorithm to
locate the correct provider.



If ProviderArchitecture is not present or if IWbemContext object is not passed, then the server
MUST find the ProviderEntryPoint corresponding to InstanceProviderId in the ProviderTable.



If ProviderArchitecture is present:







If its value is neither 32 nor 64, the server MUST return WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER.

If RequiredArchitecture is present and is set to TRUE, the server MUST find the
ProviderEntryPoint in ProviderTable corresponding to ProviderArchitecture and
InstanceProviderId.

If RequiredArchitecture is not present or set to FALSE, the server MUST find the
ProviderEntryPoint in ProviderTable corresponding to ProviderArchitecture and
InstanceProviderId. If there is no ProviderEntryPoint found, the server MUST find
ProviderEntryPoint for the given InstanceProviderId ignoring the ProviderArchitecture.

Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


If the server cannot find ProviderEntryPoint, it MUST return WBEM_E_PROVIDER_LOAD_FAILURE. If
the ProviderEntryPoint is found, the server MUST use the abstract interface defined in 3.1.4.17 to
communicate with the provider.

For all methods that create, query, update, or delete the CIM class where InstanceProviderId is
not zero, the server MUST go through each of the WQL queries in ResultSetQueries and evaluate
the WHERE clause. If the expression evaluates to TRUE for the given CIM class (that is, the provider
supports the CIM class), then the server MUST proceed with the rest of the processing for the method
as specified in the method-specific processing rules in 3.1.4. If FALSE, the server MUST return
WBEM_E_PROVIDER_NOT_CAPABLE.

For all methods that query, update, or delete the CIM classes, the server MUST obtain
InstanceProviderId for the given class from the ClassTable. If InstanceProviderId is not NULL,
and if the IWbemContext object is passed to the server, the server MUST obtain the
ProviderArchitecture from IWbemContext object. The same algorithm is used as for CIM instances.

For all methods that query, update, or delete the CIM instances, the server MAY allow the static
properties to be modified, contrary to [DMTF-DSP0004] requirements.<20>

If the server cannot find ProviderEntryPoint, it MUST return WBEM_E_PROVIDER_LOAD_FAILURE. If
the ProviderEntryPoint is found, the server MUST use the abstract interface defined in section
3.1.4.17to communicate with the provider.

For all methods where the request is sent to the provider, the provider MAY choose to perform
additional authentication or authorization, or perform the operations within the context of security
principal in which ProviderEntryPoint was called<21>

Specific rules related to creation, deletion, navigation, and persistence of the namespaces are covered
as part of section 3.1.4.18.

The server SHOULD fail the operation and return WBEM_E_ACCESS_DENIED if the namespace has the
RequiresEncryption flag set and if the DCOM security level is lower than
RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_PRIVACY.<22>

The server MAY return WBEM_E_QUOTA_VIOLATION if the number of active IWbemServices objects is
more than an implementation-defined limit for a given namespace.<23>

The server MUST fail the operation and return CO_E_SERVER_STOPPING if the RestoreInProgress
flag is set to True.

The server MUST fail the operation and return WBEM_E_SHUTTING_DOWN if the
IsServerShuttingDown flag is set to True.

If either of the BackupInProgress or IsServerPaused flags are set to True, the server MUST buffer
the request (unless the request exceeds MaxRequestLimit as described in section 3.1.4.3) until both
the BackupInProgress and IsServerPaused flags are set to False before performing the operation.

For all methods that update the CIM class, if CIM class on the server had abstract qualifier set to true,
while its parent class does not have abstract qualifier set to false, the server MUST return
WBEM_E_CANNOT_BE_ABSTRACT.

For all methods that update CIM instance, if a CIM instance with amended qualifier set to true is
being updated without WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS flag, the server MUST return
WBEM_E_AMENDED_OBJECT.

In response to the IWbemLevel1Login::NTLMLogin method, the server MUST return an IWbemServices
interface that corresponds to the wszNetworkResource parameter.

The server SHOULD enforce a maximum length for the wszNetworkResource parameter, and return
WBEM_E_QUOTA_VIOLATION if the limit is exceeded.<32>

When the call succeeds, the server MUST create an IWbemServices object. The server MUST store
the wszPreferredLocale inside the object. The server MUST find the NamespaceConnection object
for wszNetworkResource passed into the NamespaceConnectionTable, and store its reference in the
IWbemServices object. The server MUST return WBEM_E_INVALID_NAMESPACE if the
NamespaceConnection object cannot be found. The server MUST set GrantedAccess to the set of
access rights granted to the client by the namespace security descriptor.

All subsequent IWbemServices method invocations that request localized information MUST return the
information in the language that is specified in wszPreferredLocale. When the preferred locale is NULL,
the server SHOULD<33> use implementation-specific logic to decide the locale.

The successful method execution MUST fill the ppNamespace parameter with an IWbemServices
interface pointer and MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR.

The failed method execution MUST set the output parameter to NULL and MUST return an error in the
format specified in section 2.2.3. If the namespace does not exist, the server MUST return a
WBEM_E_INVALID_NAMESPACE HRESULT value.

3.1.4.2  IWbemObjectSink Interface Server Details

The IWbemObjectSink interface MUST be implemented by the WMI client if the WMI client uses
asynchronous method calls as specified in section 3.2.4.2.9. In this case, the WMI client acts as an
IWbemObjectSink server. The WMI server acts as an IWbemObjectSink client and invokes the
IWbemObjectSink methods to deliver the results (IWbemClassObjects, if any, and the status code) of
the IWbemServices method for which this IWbemObjectSink is passed as a response handler.

If the WMI client calls the IWbemServices::QueryObjectSink method, the IWbemObjectSink interface
MUST be implemented by the WMI server and MUST be returned to the client in the
ppResponseHandler parameter, as specified in section 3.1.4.3.3. In this case, the WMI server acts as
an IWbemObjectSink server. The WMI client acts as an IWbemObjectSink client and invokes the
IWbemObjectSink methods to deliver the results, that is, IWbemClassObjects that represent the
extrinsic events the client wants to deliver to the server.

Because this interface is implemented by the WMI client and the WMI server and called by both, the
server in this section refers to the implementer of this interface and the client refers to the caller in a
specific scenario.

The IWbemObjectSink interface is a DCOM Remote Protocol (as specified in [MS-DCOM]) interface.
The interface MUST be uniquely identified by UUID {7c857801-7381-11cf-884d-00aa004b2e24}.

3.1.4.2.1 IWbemObjectSink::Indicate (Opnum 3) Server details

When the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method is called, the apObjArray parameter MUST contain
additional result objects as an array of an IWbemClassObject, sent by the client to the server. The
IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method has the following syntax, expressed in Microsoft Interface
Definition Language (MIDL).

 HRESULT Indicate(
   [in] long lObjectCount,
   [in, size_is(lObjectCount)] IWbemClassObject** apObjArray
 );

lObjectCount: MUST be the number of CIM objects in the array of pointers in the ppObjArray

parameter.

apObjArray: MUST contain an array of result objects sent by the caller.

Return Values: This method MUST return an HRESULT value that MUST indicate the status of the

method call.

WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (0x00)

When the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method is called for the first time, the server that implements
the ObjectArray structure MUST return WBEM_S_NEW_STYLE if the execution of the method succeeds.
If a server does not implement the ObjectArray structure, it MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR for
successful execution of the method.

If the server implements the ObjectArray structure and WBEM_S_NEW_STYLE is returned during the
first call to the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method, the server MUST support subsequent calls to the
IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method by using both the DCOM Remote Protocol marshaling and the
ObjectArray structure as specified in section 2.2.14.

3.1.4.2.2 IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus (Opnum 4) Server Details

When the IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus method is called, the parameter MUST contain the result of
the operation or the progress status information.

 HRESULT SetStatus(
   [in] long lFlags,
   [in] HRESULT hResult,
   [in] BSTR strParam,
   [in] IWbemClassObject* pObjParam
 );

lFlags: Flags that give information about the operation status. The flags MUST be interpreted as

specified in the following table.

Note  The flags are not bit flags and cannot be combined.

hResult: The HRESULT value of the asynchronous operation or notification. This hResult MUST be the
same HRESULT that the WMI client gets from the matching synchronous operation when the
WMI client makes an asynchronous request to the WMI server.

strParam: If the parameter is NULL, the server MUST ignore the parameter. If the parameter is not

NULL, it MUST represent the operational result of the asynchronous operation. The string MUST be
the same as the string that is returned from the IWbemCallResult::GetResultString (Opnum 4)
method when the operation is executed synchronously.

pObjParam: If the parameter is NULL, the server MUST ignore the parameter. If the parameter is not
NULL, the object MUST contain additional error information for the asynchronous operation failure.

Return Values: This method MUST return an HRESULT value that MUST indicate the status of the

method call. The server MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (specified in section 2.2.11) to indicate
the successful completion of the method.

WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (0x00)

3.1.4.3  IWbemServices Interface

The IWbemServices interface exposes methods that MUST provide management services to client
processes. The implementation MUST implement all methods and return errors if the semantics of the
operation cannot be completed. IWbemServices defines the execution scope for all methods
implemented on the interface. The initial scope MUST be established by the
IWbemLevel1Login::NTLMLogin call, which returns the interface pointer.

similar to the semisynchronous execution case.

3.1.4.3.2 IWbemServices::CancelAsyncCall (Opnum 4)

The IWbemServices::CancelAsyncCall method cancels a currently pending asynchronous method call
identified by the IWbemObjectSink pointer passed to the initial asynchronous method.

 HRESULT CancelAsyncCall(
   [in] IWbemObjectSink* pSink
 );

pSink: MUST be a pointer to the IWbemObjectSink interface object that was passed to the

asynchronous method that the client wants to cancel. This parameter MUST NOT be NULL.

Return Values: This method MUST return an HRESULT value that MUST indicate the status of the

method call. The server MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (as specified in section 2.2.11) to
indicate the successful completion of the method.

Return value/code  Description

0x00

Indicates a successful completion to the method call.

WBEM_S_NO_ERROR

In response to the IWbemServices::CancelAsyncCall method, the server MUST identify and cancel all
pending asynchronous operations initiated by an asynchronous method execution, such as
IWbemServices::GetObjectAsync, which used the pSink interface pointer parameter as their
response handler. The server MUST return an error if the interface pointer is NULL, and it MUST return
an error if the pSink parameter is not associated with an entry in AsyncOperationTable.

As part of the IWbemServices::CancelAsyncCall method, the server MUST set the CallCancelled value
for this asynchronous operation entry in the AsyncOperationTable to TRUE. Setting CallCancelled to
TRUE ensures that no new IWbemObjectSink::Indicate messages or progress messages using
IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus are called to the client. If SetStatusWithFinalResultCalled is FALSE,
the server MUST set SetStatusWithFinalResultCalled to TRUE and return the error
WBEM_E_CALL_CANCELLED.

The server MUST NOT wait for any response from the client to complete the cancellation to prevent
protocol performance degradation.

The successful method execution MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR.

The failed method execution MUST return an error in the format specified in section 2.2.11.

enumeration (as specified in this section) if the enumerator is not created by using
WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY by setting the CurrentIndex entry in EnumWbemClassObjectTable
to start the index of ResultArray.

If the enumerator is created by using WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY, the server MUST return
WBEM_E_INVALID_OPERATION.

A successful method execution MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR.

A failed method execution MUST return an error in the format that is specified in section 2.2.11.

3.1.4.4.2 IEnumWbemClassObject::Next (Opnum 4)

When the IEnumWbemClassObject::Next method is invoked, the server MUST get zero or more CIM
objects starting at the current position in an enumeration. The server MUST also move the current
position by the number of CIM objects in the uCount parameter. When IEnumWbemClassObject is
created, the current position MUST be set on the first CIM object of the collection. The order of the
CIM objects that are stored in the enumerator is arbitrary.

 HRESULT Next(
   [in] long lTimeout,
   [in] ULONG uCount,
   [out, size_is(uCount), length_is(*puReturned)]
     IWbemClassObject** apObjects,
   [out] ULONG* puReturned
 );

lTimeout: MUST be the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the

IEnumWbemClassObject::Next method call allows to pass before it times out. If the constant
WBEM_INFINITE (0xFFFFFFFF) is specified, the call MUST wait until one or more CIM objects are
available. If the value 0x0 (WBEM_NO_WAIT) is specified, the call MUST return the available CIM
objects, if any, at the time the call is made, and MUST NOT wait for any more objects.

uCount: MUST be the number of requested CIM objects to return.

apObjects: MUST be a pointer to an array of IWbemClassObject interface pointers. At entry, this

parameter MUST NOT be NULL. Upon return by the server, this parameter can be NULL if a failure
occurs or if there are no results.

In response to the IEnumWbemClassObject::Next method call, the server MUST evaluate the uCount
and lTimeout parameters (as specified in this section) and MUST return the requested number of CIM
objects, if any are available. The server MUST perform the operation within the time allowed by
lTimeout.

If the earlier semisynchronous operation is finished, and if the server does not have the requested
number of CIM objects, the server MUST return WBEM_S_FALSE with the available CIM objects;
otherwise, WBEM_S_NO_ERROR is returned with the requested number of CIM objects. The current
index position pointed to by the CurrentIndex entry in EnumWbemClassObjectTable MUST be
incremented with the number of CIM objects returned.

If the earlier semisynchronous operation is not finished and the server does not have the requested
number of CIM objects, the method MUST wait the amount of time in lTimeout for the operation to
finish or for the availability of the requested number of objects, whichever is earlier. The server MUST
fill the output parameters of the method as specified previously. If the number of the remaining CIM
objects to be given to the client is less than the number of requested CIM objects, the server MUST
return WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT; otherwise, WBEM_S_NO_ERROR is returned. The current index position
pointed to by the CurrentIndex entry in EnumWbemClassObjectTable MUST be incremented with
the number of CIM objects returned.

If the original semisynchronous operation fails, the server MUST return the error code that the
original method would have returned in its synchronous version.

The failed method execution MUST set the value that is referenced by the output parameters to NULL
and MUST return an error in the format that is specified in section 2.2.11.

3.1.4.4.3 IEnumWbemClassObject::NextAsync (Opnum 5)

The IEnumWbemClassObject::NextAsync method is the asynchronous version of the
IEnumWbemClassObject::Next method. It provides controlled asynchronous retrieval of CIM objects
to a sink. The server MUST asynchronously get one or more CIM objects, starting at the current
position in an enumeration, and MUST move the current position by the number of CIM objects. When
IEnumWbemClassObject is created, the current position MUST be set on the first CIM object of the
collection. The order of the CIM objects that are stored in the enumerator is arbitrary.

 HRESULT NextAsync(
   [in] ULONG uCount,
   [in] IWbemObjectSink* pSink
 );

uCount: MUST be the number of CIM objects being requested.

pSink: MUST be a pointer to the IWbemObjectSink interface, which MUST represent the sink to

receive the CIM object. As each batch of CIM objects is requested, they MUST be delivered to the
IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method to which pSink points (as specified in section 3.1.4.2.1) and
MUST be followed by a final call to the IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus method to which pSink
points, as specified in section 3.1.4.2.2. This parameter MUST NOT be NULL. In error cases,
indicated by the HRESULT return value, the supplied IWbemObjectSink interface pointer MUST
NOT be used by the server.

Return Values: This method MUST return an HRESULT value that MUST indicate the status of the

method call. The server MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (specified in section 2.2.11) to indicate
the successful completion of the method.

WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (0x00)

The server MUST locate the entry in EnumWbemClassObjectTable with
EnumWbemClassObjectPointer matching IEnumWbemClassObject.

The server MUST validate that the security principal that makes the call is the same as the
ClientSecurityContext of the SemiSinkResultSetObject pointed to by the entry in the
EnumWbemClassObjectTable; otherwise, WBEM_E_ACCESS_DENIED MUST be returned.

The server MUST serialize execution of the IEnumWbemClassObject::Next call and asynchronous
execution of the IEnumWbemClassObject::NextAsync call, the IEnumWbemClassObject::Reset call,
and the IEnumWbemClassObject::Clone call.

In response to IEnumWbemClassObject::NextAsync, the server MUST synchronously evaluate the
uCount parameter as specified in this section. If the uCount parameter value is zero, the server MUST
return WBEM_S_FALSE. If the uCount parameter value is greater than zero, the server MUST add a
record in SinkQueue of an entry in EnumWbemClassObjectTable for this operation. The new
record in SinkQueue will store a reference to pSink in WbemObjectSinkPointer and store the
requested count in RemainingRequestCount.

The failed method execution MUST return an error in the format specified in section 2.2.11.

If the method succeeds, the server MUST wait asynchronously until either the
SemiSinkResultSetObject contains RemainingRequestCount objects starting at CurrentIndex,
or its OperationFinished flag is set to true, or the enumeration encounters an error. At that time:





If the enumeration encountered an error, the server MUST deliver the error to the client by calling
IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus.

If the enumeration finished with fewer than the requested number of objects, the server MUST
deliver them to the client by calling the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method and then indicate
completion by calling IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus with status WBEM_S_FALSE.

  Otherwise, the server MUST deliver RemainingRequestCount objects to the client by calling the

IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method and then indicate completion by calling
IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus with status WBEM_S_NO_ERROR.

The current index position pointed to by CurrentIndex in an entry of EnumWbemClassObjectTable
MUST be incremented by the number of CIM objects delivered to the client.

Finally, the server MUST remove the entry from SinkQueue.

3.1.4.4.4 IEnumWbemClassObject::Clone (Opnum 6)

The IEnumWbemClassObject::Clone method makes a logical copy of the entire enumerator. The
cloned enumerator MUST have the same current position as the source enumerator.

 HRESULT Clone(
   [out] IEnumWbemClassObject** ppEnum
 );

ppEnum: Upon return, MUST contain a pointer to an IEnumWbemClassObject interface CIM object
that is a logical copy of the entire enumerator that made the Clone method call, retaining the
current position in an enumeration. This parameter MUST NOT be NULL. When returned by the
server, this parameter can be NULL if a failure occurred or if there are no results.

Return Values: This method MUST return an HRESULT value that MUST indicate the status of the

method call. The server MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (specified in section 2.2.11) to indicate
the successful completion of the method.

WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (0x00)

The server MUST locate the entry in EnumWbemClassObjectTable with

The server MUST validate that the security principal that makes the call is the same as the
ClientSecurityContext of the SemiSinkResultSetObject pointed to by the entry in
EnumWbemClassObjectTable; otherwise, WBEM_E_ACCESS_DENIED MUST be returned.

If the earlier semisynchronous operation is created by using WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY, then
IEnumWbemClassObject::Clone is not supported and the server MUST return
WBEM_E_INVALID_OPERATION.

The server MUST serialize execution of IEnumWbemClassObject::Next call, asynchronous callbacks
related to IEnumWbemClassObject::NextAsync call, IEnumWbemClassObject::Reset call, and
IEnumWbemClassObject::Clone call.

As part of IEnumWbemClassObject::Clone, the server MUST create a new IEnumWbemClassObject
enumerator as follows. Create a new entry in the EnumWbemClassObjectTable and store a
reference to the newly created enumerator in EnumWbemClassObjectPointer. The new entry in
EnumWbemClassObjectTable will copy the current pointer index value from the earlier enumerator.
The new entry ResultSetPointer will point to SemiSinkResultSetObject that was created as part of
an earlier semisynchronous operation and increment the RefCount of SemiSinkResultSetObject by
one.

The successful method execution MUST fill the ppEnum parameter with an IEnumWbemClassObject
interface pointer, as specified in section 3.1.4.4, which MUST be a copy of the source enumerator
that retains the current position in an enumeration. The method MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR.

If the original semisynchronous operation fails, the server MUST return the error code that the original
method would have returned in its synchronous version.

The failed method execution MUST return an error in the format that is specified in section 2.2.11.

3.1.4.4.5 IEnumWbemClassObject::Skip (Opnum 7)

position in an enumeration ahead by a specified number of CIM objects.

The IEnumWbemClassObject::Skip method opnum equals 7.

 HRESULT Skip(
   [in] long lTimeout,
   [in] ULONG nCount
 );

lTimeout: MUST be the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the call to Skip allows to pass
before it times out. If the constant WBEM_INFINITE (0xFFFFFFFF) is used, the Skip method call
waits until the operation succeeds.

nCount: MUST be the number of CIM objects to skip in the enumeration. If this parameter is greater

than the number of CIM objects that remain to enumerate, the call MUST skip to the end of the
enumeration, and WBEM_S_FALSE MUST be the returned value for the method.

Return Values: This method MUST return an HRESULT value that MUST indicate the status of the

method call. The server MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (specified in section 2.2.11) to indicate
the successful completion of the method.

WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (0x00)

124 / 234


When the IWbemCallResult::GetResultObject method is called, the server MUST attempt to retrieve a
CIM object from a previous semisynchronous operation call to the IWbemServices::GetObject
method or the IWbemServices::ExecMethod method. The entry in WbemCallResultTable with
WbemCallResultPointer pointing to IWbemCallResult is used to identify the previous
semisynchronous call.

 HRESULT GetResultObject(
   [in] long lTimeout,
   [out] IWbemClassObject** ppResultObject
 );

lTimeout: MUST be the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the call to the

IWbemCallResult::GetResultObject method allows to pass before it times out. If the constant
WBEM_INFINITE (0xFFFFFFFF) is used, the GetResultObject method call MUST wait until the
operation succeeds. If this parameter is set to 0 and the result object is available at the time of
the method call, the object MUST be returned in ppResultObject and WBEM_S_NO_ERROR MUST
also be returned. If this parameter is set to 0 but the result object is not available at the time of
the method call, WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT MUST be returned.

ppResultObject: A pointer to a variable that receives a logical copy of the CIM object when the

semisynchronous operation is complete. A new CIM object MUST NOT be returned on error. When
sent by the client, this parameter value MUST NOT be NULL. Upon return by the server, this
parameter value can be NULL if there is a failure or if there are no results. The caller of this
method MUST call IWbemClassObject::Release on the returned object when the object is no
longer required.

Return Values: This method MUST return an HRESULT value that MUST indicate the status of the

method call. The server MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (specified in section 2.2.11) to indicate
the successful completion of the method.

WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (0x00)

The server MUST locate the entry in WbemCallResultTable with WbemCallResultPointer matching
IWbemCallResult.

The IWbemCallResult::GetResultObject method MUST be called on the interface obtained in responses
to a previous call to a semisynchronous operation returning an IWbemCallResult interface.

In response to the IWbemCallResult::GetResultObject method, the server MUST wait for the operation
to finish by waiting up to lTimeout for OperationFinished to become TRUE for this operation entry in
WbemCallResultTable. If the operation is finished successfully in lTimeout time, the server MUST
return the CIM object in the ppResultObject parameter by making a logical copy of ResultObject. If
the operation is not finished in lTimeout time, the server MUST return WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT. The
method MUST fail if the method parameters are not valid, as specified earlier in this section, or if the
server is unable to execute the method.

The successful method execution MUST fill ppResultObject with an IWbemClassObject interface
pointer and MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR.

If the operation is not finished in lTimeout time, this method MUST set the value referenced by the
output parameters to NULL and return WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT. The client is allowed to retry the
operation.

If the operation fails within lTimeout time, the server MUST set the value referenced by the output
parameters to NULL and return the error code that the original method would have returned in its

IWbemCallResult::GetResultString MUST be called to obtain the CIM path created after
IWbemServices::PutInstance execution. In response to the IWbemCallResult::GetResultString
method, the server MUST wait for the operation to finish in lTimeout time. The operation is finished
when OperationFinished is TRUE. If the operation is not finished in lTimeout time, the server MUST
return WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT. If the operation is finished successfully in lTimeout time, the server MUST
make a copy of the ResultString in WbemCallResultTable for this operation and return it in the
pstrResultString parameter. The method MUST fail if the method parameters are not valid, as specified
earlier in this section, or if the server is unable to execute the method. If the operation is finished
successfully, and if ResultString is set to NULL, the server MUST return
WBEM_E_INVALID_OPERATION for this method.

The successful method execution MUST fill pstrResultString with a string value of type BSTR and MUST
return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR.

The failed method execution sets the value referenced by the output parameters to NULL and MUST
return an error in the format specified in section 2.2.11. In case the operation is not completed after
lTimeout milliseconds, the server MUST return WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT and MUST allow for further retries
to be made.

proxyGUID: MUST be a client-generated GUID that MUST identify the client. This parameter MUST

NOT be NULL.

lTimeout: MUST be the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the Next method call allows
to pass before it times out. If the constant WBEM_INFINITE (0xFFFFFFFF) is used, the Skip
method call waits until the operation succeeds. This parameter MUST NOT be NULL.

uCount: MUST be the number of requested CIM objects. This parameter MUST NOT be NULL.

puReturned: MUST be a pointer to a ULONG value that MUST contain the number of CIM objects that

are returned by the Next method. This parameter MUST NOT be NULL.

pdwBuffSize: MUST be a pointer to a ULONG value that MUST contain the buffer size, in bytes. This

parameter MUST NOT be NULL.

pBuffer: MUST be a pointer to the byte array that MUST represent the packet. This parameter MUST

NOT be NULL. The byte array represents an array of CIM objects that are encoded by using the
ObjectArray format as specified in section 2.2.14. When returned by the server, this parameter
can be NULL if a failure occurs or if there are no results to return.

Return Values: This method MUST return an HRESULT value that MUST indicate the status of the

method call. The server MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (specified in section 2.2.11) to indicate
the successful completion of the method.

If a failure occurs, the server MUST return an HRESULT whose S (severity) bit is set as specified in
[MS-ERREF] section 2.1. The actual HRESULT value is implementation dependent.

WBEM_S_NO_ERROR (0x00)

The IWbemWCOSmartEnum::Next method MUST be called on an IWbemWCOSmartEnum interface
that is returned by a previous call to IWbemFetchSmartEnum::GetSmartEnum.

The server MUST locate the associated IEnumWbemClassObject interface pointer in the
EnumWbemClassObjectTable, and validate that the security principal that makes the call is the
same as the ClientSecurityContext of the SemiSinkResultSetObject pointed to by the entry in the
EnumWbemClassObjectTable; otherwise, WBEM_E_ACCESS_DENIED MUST be returned.

In response to IWbemWCOSmartEnum::Next, the server MUST evaluate the lTimeout parameter (as
specified in this section) and MUST evaluate the GUID in order to identify the client. The server MUST
return the maximum number of CIM objects that are requested by uCount.

If the server is unable to return all the requested CIM objects in the requested amount of time, it
MUST return WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT. The requested number of CIM objects MUST start from the current
index position. The current index position in the enumeration MUST be incremented by the number of
returned CIM objects.

On success, the server MUST return data in the pBuffer by using an ObjectArray structure as specified
in section 2.2.14.

The successful method execution MUST return WBEM_S_NO_ERROR. If the number of remaining CIM
objects to be retrieved is less than the number of requested CIM objects, the server MUST return
WBEM_S_FALSE. Regardless, the server MUST fill the output parameters of the method as specified in
section 2.2.14.

Abstract Provider Interface

Below are the details of the interface used between CIM server and the providers. The server uses
ProviderEntryPoint stored in ProviderTable for the given provider for performing any operation below.
For sending indications or events to the server, the provider MUST trigger 3.1.6.1.

The server MUST perform the following two processing rules for each invocation of each of the
methods listed below in this section:





Prior to the invocation, the server MUST impersonate the client (the security principal of the caller)
by invoking the abstract interface RpcImpersonateClient as specified in [MS-RPCE] section
3.3.3.4.3.2, passing in NULL as the BindingHandle parameter.

Following invocation, the server MUST stop impersonating the client prior to returning a status
code by invoking the abstract interface RpcRevertToSelf as specified in [MS-RPCE] section
3.3.3.4.3.3.

[MS-WMI] - v20240423
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

148 / 234


The provider is expected to use those credentials with IMPERSONATE level impersonation for any
necessary local access checks and remote network operations.

The server communicates asynchronously with the provider. The server creates the
IWbemObjectSink object and passes a pointer to the IWbemObjectSink object to each of the
provider operations through which the provider communicates the results back to the server. The
server then forwards the results to the client. The server deletes the IWbemObjectSink object after
receiving the status of the operation from the provider, or after calling the Cancel operation on the
provider if the client canceled the operation.

The WMI v2 provider SHOULD<73> query the WMI server for data locale for each invocation of the
method on the provider. The provider SHOULD use this locale for formatting decimals in string format
and for representing time and date in string format.

The WMI v2 provider SHOULD<74> query the WMI server for the UI locale for each invocation of the
method on the provider. The provider SHOULD use this locale when providing string output.

success, the provider returns output parameter values as IWbemClassObject instances, and a
method result (success/failure) to the server through the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method.

Note  If for a method parameter, the qualifier< IN>/<IN,OUT>/<OUT> is not specified, the server
SHOULD<75> consider the parameter as IN,OUT.

3.1.4.17.12  Cancel an Existing Operation

The server passes the pointer to the IWbemObjectSink object to the provider. The provider cancels
the pending operation corresponding to the given IWbemObjectSink object.

3.1.4.17.13  Subscribe for Event Notification

The server passes RpcImpersonationAccessToken.Sids[UserIndex]) and a pointer to the
IWbemObjectSink object to the provider. The provider performs a security access check on the
client's identity, validating that the client has WBEM_RIGHT_SUBSCRIBE permission. If the provider
does not want to grant access to the client, it returns WBEM_E_ACCESS_DENIED to the server
through IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus.

The server passes a WQL query and a pointer to the IWbemObjectSink object. The provider
communicates with the matching objects through the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate (section 3.1.4.2.1)
method. After all the matching objects are returned, or if there is a failure encountered, the provider
sends the final status using the IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus (section 3.1.4.2.2) method.

If the provider cannot process the query, then it MUST return WBEM_E_PROVIDER_NOT_CAPABLE.

3.1.4.18

Namespaces

The direct children of a given namespace are represented as instances of the _Namespace class
within the parent namespace. A client with sufficient privilege can query and modify the child
namespaces through operations on the __Namespace instances, as described in the following
subsections.

The namespaces, their corresponding classes and instances, and subnamespaces and their
corresponding classes and instances, MUST be persisted in CIM database.

3.1.4.18.1

Creating Namespaces

When the server receives a request to create a new instance of the __Namespace class, the server
MUST create a child namespace of the current namespace, using the instance's Name field as the
name of the new namespace. A corresponding ClassTable and CIM database entries MUST be
created, defining the system classes specified in section 2.2.31. The InstanceProviderId for each
class MUST be set to NULL. A NamespaceConnection MUST be created for the new namespace and
added to the NamespaceConnectionTable. If the new instance includes the
NamespaceSecuritySDDL qualifier, then the qualifier's value specifies the security descriptor of the
namespace in SDDL format; otherwise, the server MUST include an implementation-dependent default
value for the qualifier.<76>

If there is a parent namespace, the server MUST add access control entries of the parent to the
security descriptor using the algorithm in section 2.2.30.2.

The server MUST generate a __NamespaceCreationEvent event object upon successful creation of
the namespace.

The server MUST set the namespace's RequiresEncryption flag using the semantics described in
section 2.2.30.3.

3.1.4.18.2  Reading Namespace Information

When the server receives a request to get an instance of the __Namespace class, the server MUST
check for the existence of a child namespace (of the current namespace in the IWbemServices
Interface (section 3.1.4.3)) with the same name, returning WBEM_E_NOT_FOUND if none matches.
The RequiresEncryption and NamespaceSecuritySDDL qualifiers MUST be set to the values of the
child namespace's RequiresEncryption flag and security descriptor, respectively.

Similarly, when a client enumerates instances of the __Namespace class, the server MUST return a
set of instances corresponding to the child namespaces of the current namespace.

See Appendix D: Enumerating Class Schema for an example.

3.1.4.18.3  Updating Namespace Information

[MS-WMI] - v20240423
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

151 / 234


When the server receives a request to put an instance of the __Namespace class, the server MUST
check for the existence of a child namespace (of the current namespace in the IWbemServices
interface) with the same name, returning WBEM_E_NOT_FOUND if none matches. The server MUST
update the namespace information based on the qualifiers of the received instance, just as during
namespace creation (see section 3.1.4.18.1 for details).

The server MUST generate a __NamespaceModificationEvent event object upon successful
modification of the namespace information.

3.1.4.18.4  Deleting Namespaces

When the server receives a request to delete an instance of the __Namespace class, the server
MUST check for the existence of a child namespace (of the current namespace in the IWbemServices
interface) with the same name, returning WBEM_E_NOT_FOUND if none matches. The server MUST
delete all classes and instances in the child namespace and all descendants from the CIM database.
The server MUST delete the NamespaceConnection objects for each of the namespaces in the
hierarchy and MUST remove the corresponding entries from NamespaceConnectionTable. The
server MUST delete the ClassTable corresponding to each of the namespaces in the hierarchy.

The server MUST generate a __NamespaceDeletionEvent event object upon successful modification
of the namespace information.

3.1.5  Timer Events

The Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol uses four timers:

Sink timer: If the timer expires and the call is not completed, the server MUST cancel the

asynchronous operation for which the timer expired.

Backup Timer: If the timer expires, the server MUST resume operations by simulating

IWbemBackupRestoreEx::Resume and MUST reset the timer to 0.

EventPollingTimer: If the timer expires, the server MUST query for the instances of the underlying
CIM class (for which the notifications are requested) in the corresponding EventFilter in the
EventBindingTable, and store them in CurrInstances (which is array of IWbemClassObject
objects). The server MUST compare CurrInstances to PrevInstances already stored in the
event.







If an instance exists only in CurrInstances and is not present in PrevInstances, and the
FROM clause of the EventFilter has __InstanceCreationEvent, the server MUST prepare an
__InstanceCreationEvent object with the TargetInstance set to new object found in
CurrInstances array.

If an instance only exists in PrevInstances and is not present in CurrInstances, and the
FROM clause of the EventFilter has __InstanceDeletionEvent, the server MUST prepare an
__InstanceDeletionEvent object with the TargetInstance set to old object in
PrevInstances array.

If the instance exists in both the arrays, then the server MUST compare the properties of the
objects. If they are not same and the FROM clause of the EventFilter has
__InstanceModificationEvent, the server MUST prepare an
__InstanceModificationEvent object with the PreviousInstance set to old object in
PrevInstances array and the TargetInstance set to new object found in CurrInstances
array.

The server MUST add each of the above events object prepared to the EventQueue, deliver the
events that have accumulated in the EventQueue (ignoring delivery failures), clear the queue,
move CurrInstances array into PrevInstances array, and restart the timer.

EventGroupingTimer: If the timer expires, the server MUST

1.  Follow the same procedure followed for EventPollingTimer to create the

__InstanceCreationEvent, __InstanceDeletionEvent, and
__InstanceModificationEvent events, and add them to EventGroupAggregateQueue.

2.  Examine the events that have accumulated in the EventGroupAggregateQueue and discard

those that do not match the "HAVING" clause of the filter (if specified).

3.  Deliver the remaining events to the client, ignoring delivery failures.

4.  Clear EventGroupAggregateQueue.

5.  Restart the timer.

3.1.6  Other Local Events

None.

3.1.6.1  Indication Event Is Generated

The server MUST execute the following algorithm for each row of the EventBindingTable.

1.  Check whether the indication matches the EventFilter. If not, then skip to the next row.

2.  If the SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR property of indication is available, check whether client has access
to this indication by Validating the SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR property of the indication against
ClientSecurityContext. If the client does not have access, the server MUST ignore this
indication.

3.  If an EventGroupingTimer exists in this row, search the EventGroupAggregateQueue for an

event that meets the matching criteria specified in the "BY" clause of the filter (or any event, if no
"BY" clause was specified). If no matching event is found, create a new __AggregateEvent with
a copy of the indication in the Representative property and one in the NumberOfEvents property;
otherwise, increment the event's NumberOfEvents property. If the number of rows in the
EventGroupAggregateQueue is more than EventDropLimit, return
WBEM_E_QUEUE_OVERFLOW to the client.  If the EventGroupingTimer is not currently active,
then start it.

4.  Otherwise, if an EventPollingTimer exists in this row, then add the indication to the

EventQueue.  If the number of rows in the EventQueue is more than EventDropLimit, return
WBEM_E_QUEUE_OVERFLOW to the client.

5.  Otherwise, deliver the indication to the client via the EventConsumer interface in that row.

3.1.6.2  Load Provider

The server creates a provider instance and passes namespace name, locale ID,
ProviderArchitectureType, and a pointer to callback into it. If the provider initialization was successful,
the server creates an entry for the given provider in ProviderTable with ProviderEntryPoint as
pointer to the provider instance created above. The server will proceed with the specific client's
request upon successful load of the provider. The error encountered during load will be sent to the
server, and the server terminates the client's request with WBEM_E_PROVIDER_LOAD_FAILURE.

3.1.6.3  Unload Provider

The server removes the entry for the corresponding provider in ProviderTable. The server deletes
the provider instance created as part of 3.1.6.2. If an error is encountered during the Unload, it will be
returned to the server.

3.2  Client Details

3.2.1  Abstract Data Model

The client MUST maintain association between _WBEM_REFRESHER_ID and the objects refreshed in
respective ID by the server. This information MUST be passed to the server when reconnecting the
refresher.

3.2.2  Timers

None

3.2.3  Initialization

The client MUST activate the IWbemLevel1Login interface on the machine that is running the target
WMI server by using the CLSID {8BC3F05E-D86B-11D0-A075-00C04FB68820}, as specified in the
DCOM Remote Protocol ([MS-DCOM]). The client SHOULD obtain the IWbemLoginClientID interface by
using the IRemUnknown and IRemUnknown2 interfaces, [MS-DCOM], on the IWbemLevel1Login
interface. If the server returns an error for the IWbemLoginClientID interface, the client MUST ignore
the error. If the server returns the IWbemLoginClientID interface, the client SHOULD call the
IWbemLoginClientID::SetClientInfo method to set the client information on the server.<77>

The client SHOULD NOT obtain the IWbemLoginHelper interface from IWbemLevel1Login by calling the
IRemUnknown and IRemUnknown2 interfaces.<78>

The client MUST call the IWbemLevel1Login::NTLMLogin method. If the
IWbemLevel1Login::NTLMLogin method completes successfully, the ppNamespace parameter has an
IWbemServices interface pointer that can be used by the client to call the IWbemServices methods.

If the client has multiple preferred locales or any locale string that does not match the "MS_xxx"
format as the pszPreferredLocale parameter to IWbemLevel1Login::NTLMLogin, the client MUST
determine whether the server supports the locale and filter out unsupported locales before calling
IWbemLevel1Login::NTLMLogin. To determine supported locales, the client MUST call
IWbemLevel1Login::EstablishPosition If the return value is E_NOTIMPL, the client MUST choose the
first locale that matches the "MS_xxx" format and MUST remove other locales from the string.

If the locale list is empty after unsupported locales are filtered out,<79> the client MUST pass NULL
for pszPreferredLocale.

3.2.4  Message Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

If the client detects that the IWbemClassObject that is returned by the WMI server does not conform
to [MS-WMIO] encoding, as specified in section 2.2.4, the results MUST be ignored and the requested
operation MUST be considered as failed.

For each operation that accepts an IWbemContext object, the client SHOULD generate a new,
unique request ID, and set the __CorrelationId context option to the request ID.<80>

3.2.4.1  IWbemObjectSink Interface Client Details

The IWbemObjectSink interface is implemented by the WMI client if the WMI client uses asynchronous
method calls as specified in section 3.2.4.2.9. In this case, the WMI client acts as an
IWbemObjectSink server. The WMI server acts as an IWbemObjectSink client. The WMI server MUST
invoke the IWbemObjectSink methods to deliver the results (IWbemClassObjects, if any, and the
status code) of the IWbemServices method for which this IWbemObjectSink is passed as a response
handler, as specified in section 3.1.1.1.3.

Because this interface is implemented by the WMI client and the WMI server and invoked by both, the
server in this section refers to the implementer of this interface, and client refers to the invoker in a
specific scenario.

The IWbemObjectSink interface is implemented by the WMI server and returned to the WMI client in a
ppResponseHandler parameter, if the WMI client calls the IWbemServices::QueryObjectSink method.
In this case, the WMI server acts as an IWbemObjectSink server. The WMI client acts as an
IWbemObjectSink client. The WMI client MUST invoke IWbemObjectSink methods to deliver the
results, that is, IWbemClassObjects that represent the extrinsic event the client wants to deliver to the
server.

Method

Description

Indicate

Called by the client to return additional results.

Opnum: 3

SetStatus  Called by the client either to indicate the end of an operation or to send status information to the

server.

Opnum: 4

3.2.4.1.1 IWbemObjectSink::Indicate Client Details

If there are no IWbemClassObject results to be reported, the client MUST NOT call the
IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method.

Otherwise, the client MUST call the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method one or more times until the
entire IWbemClassObject results are delivered to the server. Each time the
IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method is called, a subset of the result is delivered to the server. For a
specific set of result objects, the client uses implementation-specific criteria to choose the number and
timing of the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method calls that are used to deliver the result
objects.<81>

Clients that implement the ObjectArray structure MUST call IWbemObjectSink::Indicate by using
DCOM Remote Protocol marshaling, as specified in [MS-DCOM], for the first time. If a server returns
WBEM_S_NEW_STYLE, the client SHOULD send the remainder of the results by using the ObjectArray
structure as specified in section 2.2.14. If the server does not return WBEM_S_NEW_STYLE, the client
MUST send the remainder of the results from  the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate call by using DCOM
Remote Protocol marshaling, as specified in [MS-DCOM], and MUST NOT use the ObjectArray
structure.

The following applies when the WMI server acts as an IWbemObjectSink client:

For each asynchronous operation, there MUST be only one call at a time: either
IWbemObjectSink::Indicate or IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus. This is ensured by calling
IWbemObjectSink::Indicate only if CallbackInProgress is FALSE. Set CallbackInProgress to TRUE
before calling IWbemObjectSink::Indicate, and reset it to FALSE after the call is returned.
IWbemOjbectSink::Indicate MUST NOT be called if CallCancelled is set to TRUE.

155 / 234

[MS-WMI] - v20240423
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


If IWbemObjectSink::Indicate returns an error, the server MUST do the following:

1.  Set CallCancelled to TRUE in AsyncOperationTable for the entry identified by this

IWbemObjectSink.

2.  Send the final result with WBEM_E_CALL_CANCELLED.

3.  Remove the entry for this operation in AsyncOperationTable.

3.2.4.1.2 IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus Client Details

The client MUST call the IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus method operation to send the final status of the
IWbemServices method operation by passing WBEM_STATUS_COMPLETE as an lFlags parameter and
the operation return code as an HRESULT parameter. After calling IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus with
final status information, the client MUST release the IWbemObjectSink interface and MUST NOT call
any other methods of IWbemObjectSink.

When the reported operation status is success, the client MUST set the pObjParam parameter to NULL.

The client MAY call IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus multiple times during the operation execution to
report the operation progress.<82> In this case, lFlags MUST be set to WBEM_STATUS_PROGRESS
and the hResult parameter MUST contain the progress information.

When sending operation progress information, the client MAY call IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus any
time before final status is sent.

The following applies when the WMI server acts as an IWbemObjectSink client.

For each asynchronous operation, there MUST only be one call at a time of either
IWbemObjectSink::Indicate or IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus (for operation progress information). This
is ensured by calling IWbemObjectSink::Indicate only if CallbackInProgress is FALSE. Set
CallbackInProgress to TRUE before calling operation progress information by
IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus, and reset to FALSE after the call returns. Operation progress by
IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus MUST NOT be called if CallCancelled is TRUE.

If operation progress information by IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus returns an error, the server MUST
do the following:

1.  Set CallCancelled to TRUE in AsyncOperationTable for the entry identified by this

IWbemObjectSink.

2.  Send the final result with WBEM_E_CALL_CANCELLED.

3.  Remove the entry for this operation in AsyncOperationTable.

##### 3.2.4.2 IWbemServices Interface Client Details

###### 3.2.4.2.1 Sending Events to Server

If the client wants to send the events to the WMI server, the client MUST call the
IWbemServices::QueryObjectSink method on the IWbemObjectSink interface that is obtained as
specified in section 3.2.3. When the method execution succeeds, the client gets the IWbemObjectSink
interface. The extrinsic events, represented as IWbemClassObject Prototype Result Object, as
specified in 2.2.4.1, MUST be delivered to the server by calling IWbemObjectSink::Indicate.When the
client completes delivering the extrinsic events, the client MUST release the IWbemObjectSink.

###### 3.2.4.2.2 Calling Put Interfaces for CIM Objects with Amended Qualifiers

[MS-WMI] - v20240423
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024

156 / 234


If the client calls the PutClass, PutClassAsync, PutInstance, or PutInstanceAsync method to update or
create a CIM Object that contains amended qualifiers, the client SHOULD set the
WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS flag.

To create a new class with amended qualifiers, the client MUST first separate the class into a locale-
neutral class object and a locale-specific class object, with contents as described in section 3.1.1.2.
Then the client MUST make multiple calls to PutClass or PutClassAsync; one to create the locale-
neutral class object and one for each supported locale to construct the locale-specific class object. The
client SHOULD create the locale-neutral object last.

###### 3.2.4.2.3 Deleting Class Objects with Amended Qualifiers

To delete a class with amended qualifiers, the client MUST delete the locale-neutral class object and
the locale-specific class object. The client MUST make multiple calls to DeleteClass or
DeleteClassAsync; one to delete the locale-neutral class object and one for each supported locale to
delete the locale-specific class object. The client SHOULD delete the locale-neutral object first.

###### 3.2.4.2.4 Invoking Synchronous Methods Returing No Object

If the client wants to invoke following WMI methods synchronously, the client MUST NOT set
WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY when making method calls. When the method completes, the
result of the operation is returned as return value. List of methods returning no objects in synchronous
mode are









IWbemServices::PutInstance

IWbemServices::PutClass

IWbemServices::DeleteClass

IWbemServices::DeleteInstance

###### 3.2.4.2.5 IWbemServices::ExecMethod and IWbemServices::ExecMethodAsync

The client MUST create a CIM instance for the input parameter CIM class defined in [MS-WMIO]
section 2.3.3. The values of the CIM instance properties MUST be set to the values of the input
parameters of the method by matching the parameter name to the property name. This CIM instance
MUST be passed to IWbemServices::ExecMethod (section 3.1.4.3.22) or
IWbemServices::ExecMethodAsync (section 3.1.4.3.23) as pInParams.

The output parameters from the method invocation will be returned as an instance of output
parameter CIM class as defined in [MS-WMIO] section 2.3.3. Depending on how the method is
invoked, the resultant object is returned in one of the ways as described in sections 3.2.4.2.6,
3.2.4.2.7, or 3.2.4.2.9.

###### 3.2.4.2.6 Invoking Synchronous Methods Returning Single Object

If the client wants to invoke any of the following WMI methods synchronously, the client MUST NOT
set WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY when making method calls. When the method completes
successfully, the output parameter contains the result object of the operation. The following table lists
the methods and output parameter containing the result object of the operation.

###### 3.2.4.2.7 Invoking Semisynchronous Methods That Return a Single Object

If the client wants to invoke any of the following WMI methods semisynchronously, the client MUST
set WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY when it makes the method calls.

When the method returns success, the IWbemCallResult parameter MUST be used to get the result of
the actual semisynchronous operation. The client MUST call the methods of IWbemCallResult, as
specified in the following table, to obtain the results of the semisynchronous operation that is initiated
by the client. The client MUST NOT call other methods of IWbemCallResult except as specified in the
following table.

Method

Rule

IWbemServices::OpenNamespace  The IWbemCallResult::GetResultServices method MUST be called to retrieve

the IWbemServices pointer.

IWbemServices::PutInstance

The IWbemCallResult::GetResultString method MUST be called to obtain the
CIM path that was assigned to the CIM instance.

IWbemServices::GetObject

The IWbemCallResult::GetResultObject method MUST be called to retrieve
the CIM object.

IWbemServices::PutClass

IWbemServices::DeleteClass

IWbemServices::DeleteInstance

IWbemServices::ExecMethod

The IWbemCallResult::GetCallStatus method MUST be called to return the
call status.

The IWbemCallResult::GetResultObject method MUST be called to retrieve
the output parameters.

When the semisynchronous IWbemServices method fails, the output parameter does not have the
IWbemCallResult interface.

###### 3.2.4.2.8 Invoking Synchronous and Semisynchronous Operations Returning Multiple

Objects

If the client wants to invoke any of the following WMI methods semisynchronously, the client MUST
set WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY when making method calls. If the client wants to invoke any
of the following methods synchronously, the client MUST NOT set
WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY when making IWbemServices method calls.

The methods returning multiple objects are as follows:









IWbemServices::ExecQuery

IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnum

IWbemServices::CreateClassEnum

IWbemServices::ExecNotificationQuery

When the method execution fails, as indicated by the return value, the output parameter does not
have IEnumWbemClassObject.

When IWbemServices method execution succeeds, an object of type IEnumWbemClassObject is
returned to the client.

The client SHOULD obtain IWbemFetchSmartEnum interface using IRemUnknown and IRemUnknown2
interfaces as specified in [MS-DCOM], on this IEnumWbemClassObject interface. If client obtains

[MS-WMI] - v20240423
Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


IWbemFetchSmartEnum, the client MUST call IWbemFetchSmartEnum::GetSmartEnum to obtain
IWbemWCOSmartEnum. The client SHOULD call IWbemWCOSmartEnum::Next method repeatedly to
retrieve the objects. When IWbemWCOSmartEnum::Next returns WBEM_S_NO_ERROR or
WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT, the client SHOULD call IEnumWbemClassObject::Next again. If
IWbemWCOSmartEnum::Next returns an error as specified in 2.2.11 or returns WBEM_S_FALSE, the
client MUST NOT call IWbemWCOSmartEnum::Next again.

If the server returns an error when obtaining IWbemFetchSmartEnum, the client MUST ignore the
error and SHOULD call IEnumWbemClassObject::Next method repeatedly to retrieve the objects.
When IEnumWbemClassObject::Next returns WBEM_S_NO_ERROR or WBEM_S_TIMEDOUT, the client
SHOULD call IEnumWbemClassObject::Next again. If IEnumWbemClassObject::Next returns an error
as specified in 2.2.11 or returns WBEM_S_FALSE, the client MUST NOT call
IEnumWbemClassObject::Next again.

When the client made a semisynchronous call and subsequent IEnumWbemClassObject::Next or
IWbemWCOSmartEnum::Next call returns an error, the client MUST interpret the error as the error of
actual semisynchronous operation as though the operation is executed synchronously.

The client MUST NOT call IEnumWbemClassObject::Reset or IEnumWbemClassObject::Clone, if the
IWbemServices method that created the IEnumWbemClassObject is passed
WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY flag.

If the client wants to start the enumerator from the first object, the client MUST call
IEnumWbemClassObject::Reset, if the IWbemServices method that created the
IEnumWbemClassObject is not passed WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY flag.

If the client wants to create a new enumerator containing the same result set, the client MUST call
IEnumWbemClassObject::Clone, if the IWbemServices method that created the
IEnumWbemClassObject is not passed WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY flag. The client SHOULD use
IEnumWbemClassObject created using IEnumWbemClassObject::Clone as another result object by
calling IEnumWbemClassObject::Next.

If the client wants to get some results of the operation asynchronously, the client MUST call
IEnumWbemClassObject::NextAsync with the uCount, in this case next uCount result objects are
returned in IWbemObjectSink passed as a parameter to IEnumWbemClassObject::NextAsync.

If the client wants to invoke any of the above asynchronous methods, the client MUST pass an object
implementing IWbemObjectSink interface to the above method calls as a response handler.

When the method invocation succeeds, the client SHOULD wait for the result of the operation to be
returned to the client using IWbemObjectSink::Indicate and IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus on the
IWbemObjectSink passed to the asynchronous method.

When the IWbemServices method invocation fails, the result of the operation is returned as a return
value of the method.

After the IWbemServices  asynchronous method invocation succeeds, if the client wants to cancel the
pending asynchronous operation the client MUST call IWbemServices::CancelAsyncCall method. If
the client calls IWbemServices::CancelAsyncCall, the client MUST pass the IWbemObjectSink passed
to the asynchronous IWbemServices method that is still pending. The client MUST NOT call
IWbemServices::CancelAsyncCall from within a call to IWbemObjectSink::Indicate or
IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus.

##### 3.2.4.3 IWbemBackupRestore Interface Client Details

If client wants to invoke methods of IWbemBackupRestore interface, the client MUST activate
IWbemBackupRestore interface on the target WMI server machine using CLSID {C49E32C6-BC8B-
11D2-85D4-00105A1F8304} as specified in DCOM remote protocol.

##### 3.2.4.4 IWbemBackupRestoreEx Interface Client Details

If client wants to invoke methods of IWbemBackupRestoreEx interface, the client MUST activate
IWbemBackupRestoreEx interface on the target WMI server using CLSID {C49E32C6-BC8B-11D2-
85D4-00105A1F8304} as specified in DCOM remote protocol. The client MAY obtain
IWbemBackupRestoreEx by calling IRemUnknown and IRemUnknown2 interfaces, as specified in [MS-
DCOM], on IWbemBackupRestore interface obtained as specified in section 3.1.4.10.

##### 3.2.4.5 IWbemRefreshingServices Interface Client Details

The client MUST obtain IWbemRefreshingServices interface, if the client wants to get updates to the
objects in an efficient manner. The client MUST obtain IWbemRefreshingServices interface by calling
IRemUnknown and IRemUnknown2 on IWbemServices interface obtained as specified in section 3.2.3.

The client MUST generate _WBEM_REFRESHER_ID as specified in section 2.2.21. The client MAY call
IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresher,
IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresherByTemplate or
IWbemRefreshingServices::AddEnumToRefresher to add multiple objects and enums to the refresher.

###### 3.2.4.5.1 IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresher and

IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresherByTemplate

The client MUST pass the _WBEM_REFRESHER_ID that is generated as specified in section 2.2.21 to
the IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresher and
IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresherByTemplate methods.

When the client calls the IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresher or
IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresherByTemplate method with pRefresherId generated by
the client, the server returns the refresher information in the _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO structure if the
method succeeds.

The client MUST allow all the version numbers that are returned by the server in pdwSvrRefrVersion.

If the returned _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO structure contains m_lType as
WBEM_REFRESH_TYPE_REMOTE, the m_Info structure contains the _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO_REMOTE

structure. The client MUST obtain the IWbemRemoteRefresher from the m_pRefresher in
_WBEM_REFRESH_INFO_REMOTE. The client MUST use the IWbemRemoteRefresher::RemoteRefresh
method to get the updated object. If the client wants to remove the particular object from the remote
refresher, the client MUST use m_lCancelId, which is returned in _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO, to invoke
the IWbemRemoteRefresher::StopRefreshing method.

If the returned _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO structure contains m_lType as
WBEM_REFRESH_TYPE_NON_HIPERF, the client MUST retrieve the CIM instance using
IWbemServices::GetObject or IWbemServices::GetObjectAsync on the initial IWbemServices
interface.

When the IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresher or
IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresherByTemplate method fails, the server does not return
the _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO structure.

###### 3.2.4.5.2 IWbemRefreshingServices::AddEnumToRefresher

The client MUST pass the _WBEM_REFRESHER_ID that is generated as specified in section 2.2.21 to
the IWbemRefreshingServices::AddEnumToRefresher method.

When the client calls the IWbemRefreshingServices::AddEnumToRefresher method with pRefresherId
generated by the client, the server returns the refresher information in the _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO
structure if the method succeeds.

The client MUST allow all the version numbers that are returned by the server in pdwSvrRefrVersion.

If the returned _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO structure contains m_lType as
WBEM_REFRESH_TYPE_REMOTE, the m_Info structure contains the
_WBEM_REFRESH_INFO_REMOTE structure. The client MUST obtain the IWbemRemoteRefresher
from the m_pRefresher in _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO_REMOTE. The client MUST use the
IWbemRemoteRefresher::RemoteRefresh method to get the updated enumeration. The client MUST
use m_lCancelId, which is returned in _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO, to invoke the
IWbemRemoteRefresher::StopRefreshing method if the client wants to remove the particular
enumeration from the remote refresher.

If the returned _WBEM_REFRESH_INFO structure contains m_lType as
WBEM_REFRESH_TYPE_NON_HIPERF, the client MUST retrieve the CIM instances using
IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnum or IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnumAsync on the initial
IWbemServices interface.

When the IWbemRefreshingServices::AddEnumToRefresher method fails, the client MUST NOT use the
_WBEM_REFRESH_INFO structure.

###### 3.2.4.5.3 IWbemRefreshingServices::GetRemoteRefresher

When invoking the methods of the IWbemRemoteRefresher interface, if the connection is lost and
reported to the client as an RPC disconnect error (as specified in [MS-ERREF]), the client SHOULD try
to reconnect to WMI by obtaining IWbemServices as specified in section 3.2.3 and to obtain the
IWbemRemoteRefresher interface using the IWbemServices interface as specified in section 3.2.4.5,
and SHOULD call the IWbemRefreshingServices::GetRemoteRefresher method on this interface.

If the IWbemRefreshingServices::GetRemoteRefresher method call succeeds, the client gets a GUID of
the remote refresher in the pGuid parameter.

The client MUST allow all the version numbers that are returned by the server in the
pdwSvrRefrVersion parameter.

If the GUID is equal to the GUID that is returned in WBEM_REFRESH_INFO_REMOTE when the remote
refresher is first received by calling either IWbemRefreshingServices::AddEnumToRefresher,

IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresher, or
IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresherByTemplate, the client MUST NOT call
IWbemRefreshingServices::ReconnectRemoteRefresher. The client SHOULD call
IWbemRemoteRefresher::RemoteRefresh on the IWbemRemoteRefresher interface, which is obtained
by using IWbemRefreshingServices::GetRemoteRefresher to refresh the object. The client MUST NOT
call the methods on the IWbemRemoteRefresher interface whose connection is initially lost.

If the GUID is not equal to the GUID that is returned in WBEM_REFRESH_INFO_REMOTE when the
remote refresher is first received by calling either IWbemRefreshingServices::AddEnumToRefresher,
IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresher or
IWbemRefreshingServices::AddObjectToRefresherByTemplate, the client MUST call
IWbemRefreshingServices::ReconnectRemoteRefresher to reconnect all the objects to the refresher.
The client MUST NOT call methods on the new remote refresher until
IWbemRefreshingServices::ReconnectRemoteRefresher is executed successfully. The client MUST NOT
call methods on the IWbemRemoteRefresher interface whose connection is lost initially.

If the IWbemRefreshingServices::GetRemoteRefresher method call fails, the client SHOULD retry after
allowing a time-out.

###### 3.2.4.5.4 IWbemRefreshingServices::ReconnectRemoteRefresher

The client SHOULD call IWbemRefreshingServices::ReconnectRemoteRefresher if the
IWbemRemoteRefresher method call failed and the client is attempting to reconnect the remote
refresher as specified in section 3.2.4.5.3.

The client MUST allow all the version numbers that are returned by the server in pdwSvrRefrVersion.

When the method executes successfully, the client MUST validate all _WBEM_RECONNECT_RESULTS
to see if any object or enumerator has failed to be added to the refresher.

##### 3.2.4.6 IUnsecuredApartment Interface Client Details

The client MUST NOT activate or QueryInterface for the IUnsecuredApartment interface.

##### 3.2.4.7 IWbemUnsecuredApartment Interface Client Details

The client MUST NOT activate or QueryInterface for the IWbemUnsecuredApartment interface.

##### 3.2.4.8 IWbemShutdown Interface Client Details

The client MUST NOT activate or QueryInterface for the IWbemShutdown interface.

#### 3.2.5 Timer Events

None.

#### 3.2.6 Other Local Events

None.

## 4 Protocol Examples

The following sections describe several operations as used in common scenarios to illustrate the
function of the Windows Management Instrumentation Remote Protocol.

### 4.1 Protocol Initialization

The protocol is initiated by the DCOM Remote Protocol activation of the CLSID _IWbemLevel1Login.

The examples are performed using the wbemtest utility. Network captures with annotations for a
number of examples are available from [SysDocCap-WMI].

The figure below illustrates one possible sequence of steps that the WMI client takes during
establishment of connection with WMI server.

For a client application to connect to the WMI service on a remote server, the client application first
obtains an IWbemLevel1Login interface pointer to the server on the remote computer by using the
DCOM activation. The client then obtains IWbemLoginClientID by calling IRemUnknown using
IWbemLevel1Login. The client calls IWbemLoginClientID::SetClientInfo. Then the client obtains
IWbemLoginHelper by calling IRemUnknown using IWbemLevel1Login. The client calls
IWbemLoginHelper::SetEvent to determine whether the WMI server is running on the same machine.
Finally, the client calls the IWbemLevel1Login::NTLMLogin method to obtain an IWbemServices
interface pointer. The IWbemServices interface pointer is the starting point for all other activities.

This section contains information about the messages exchanged as part of the protocol initialization
between SAI-NAV009 (client) and SAI-NAV009-2 (server). The specific trace is taken as part of
IWbemServices::ExecQuery call. For brevity, only the relevant traces are shown here.

#### 4.2.1 Synchronous Delivery of a Single Result

The IWbemServices::GetObject and IWbemServices::ExecMethod methods support synchronous calls
returning a single marshaled IWbemClassObject interface pointer.

Figure 12: Synchronous delivery of a single result

#### 4.2.2 Synchronous Delivery of Result Sets

In this context of operation, there are two kinds of client behavior and two kinds of server behavior,
depending in the product version, resulting in four cases of client-server interaction.

The client behaviors are as follows:

  Unoptimized client behavior<83>

  Optimized client behavior<84>

The server behaviors are as follows:

  Unoptimized server behavior<85>

  Optimized server behavior<86>

The resulting client-server interactions are defined in the following sections:

  Unoptimized Client and Unoptimized Server (section 4.2.2.1)

  Unoptimized Client and Optimized Server (section 4.2.2.2)

  Optimized Client and Optimized Server (section 4.2.2.3)

  Optimized Client and Unoptimized Server (section 4.2.2.4)

##### 4.2.2.1 Unoptimized Client and Unoptimized Server

The product versions that exhibit unoptimized client behavior and unoptimized server behavior are
referenced in section 4.2.2.

To make a synchronous operation from a client to a server, the client uses the IWbemServices
interface pointer. The client calls the IWbemServices synchronous methods
IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnum, IWbemServices::CreateClassEnum, and
IWbemServices::ExecQuery. In response to the method executed, the server returns an
IEnumWbemClassObject interface pointer. The client then uses the IEnumWbemClassObject::Next
method to repeatedly retrieve the IWbemClassObject objects from the query result set.

IEnumWbemClassObject interface pointer. The client then uses the IEnumWbemClassObject::Next
method to repeatedly retrieve the IWbemClassObject objects from the query result set.

The call sequence is the same as that in section 4.2.2.1 because in both cases, the client is
unoptimized, and therefore still uses the old mechanism for communication. Sections 4.2.2.3 and
##### 4.2.2.4 explain the call sequences between the newer versions of client and server.

IEnumWbemClassObject interface pointer. The operation fails because the server is not implementing
the IWbemFetchSmartEnum interface. The client falls back to unoptimized client behavior.

##### 4.2.3.1 Synchronous Delivery of IWbemServices ExecQuery and ExecMethod

Operations

This section contains the information exchanged between SAI-NAV009 (client) and SAI-NAV009-2
(server).

First the client tries to connect to the server and obtains IwbemServices for namespace root\cimv2
as outlined in 4.1.1.

Client calls ExecQuery method on IWbemServices interface pointer with "select * from
win32_process where Name='calc.exe'" as strQuery. It is assumed that an instance of calc.exe is
running on the server:

 - WMI: IWbemServices:ExecQuery Request, Flags=32
   + StrQueryLanguage: WQL
   + StrQuery: select * from win32_process where Name='calc.exe'
   + Pad: 2 Bytes
   + Flags: 32 (0x20)
   + Ctx: NULL

In response to the method executed above, the server returns an IEnumWbemClassObject interface
pointer:

 - WMI: IWbemServices:ExecQuery Response, ReturnValue=WBEM_S_NO_ERROR
   + Enum: OBJREFSTANDARD - {027947E1-D731-11CE-A357-000000000001}
   + Pad: 2 Bytes
     ReturnValue: 0x00000000 - WBEM_S_NO_ERROR - Indicates a successful completion to the
method call.

The client uses IRemUnknown and IRemUnknown2, as specified in [MS-DCOM], to obtain an
IWbemFetchSmartEnum interface pointer from the IEnumWbemClassObject interface pointer. From
this the client knows whether the server is optimized:

 - DCOM: IRemUnknown2:RemQueryInterface Request, DCOM Version=5.7  Causality Id={8E2416FE-
0A3F-42BE-A9B0-F30624C94619}

     NumRequestedIIds: 1 (0x1)
   + Size: 1 Elements
   + InterfaceIds:

Server responds with a valid IWbemFetchSmartEnum interface pointer. This means that the server is
optimized:

The client then calls the IWbemFetchSmartEnum::GetSmartEnum method to obtain the
IWbemWCOSmartEnum interface pointer:

 WMI: IWbemFetchSmartEnum:GetSmartEnum Request

Server responds with a valid IWbemWCOSmartEnum interface pointer:

 - WMI: IWbemFetchSmartEnum:GetSmartEnum Response, ReturnValue=WBEM_S_NO_ERROR
   + SmartEnum: OBJREFSTANDARD - {423EC01E-2E35-11D2-B604-00104B703EFD}
   + Pad: 2 Bytes
     ReturnValue: 0x00000000 - WBEM_S_NO_ERROR - Indicates a successful completion to the
method call.

The client uses the IWbemWCOSmartEnum::Next method repeatedly to retrieve the
IwbemClassObject interface pointers that contains the result set:

 - WMI: IWbemWCOSmartEnum:Next Request, Timeout=0 UCount=10
     proxyGUID: {7F666EB6-FA61-48E8-8464-224C8E909D22}
     Timeout: WBEM_NO_WAIT(Call returns immediately, regardless of whether any objects are
available.)
     UCount: 10 (0xA)

Server responds with the result set with one win32_process object for calc.exe instance running. The
results are encoded as an ObjectArray as specified in section 2.2.14:

 - WMI: IWbemWCOSmartEnum:Next Response, PuReturned=1 BuffSize=9101 ReturnValue=0x00000300 -
Unknown Value
     PuReturned: 1 (0x1)
     BuffSize: 9101 (0x238D)

Client obtains __RELPATH property from IwbemClassObject as \\SAI-NAV009-
2\root\cimv2:Win32_Process.Handle="724".

Client makes ExecMethod operation on IWbemServices interface pointer to call terminate() method on
win32_process object corresponding to calc.exe instance obtained above. This action terminates the
process calc.exe on the server:

   + CallResult: NULL
     Pad: 0 Bytes
     ReturnValue: 0x00000000 - WBEM_S_NO_ERROR - Indicates a successful completion to the
method call.)

To confirm that calc.exe instance is indeed terminated on the server, client makes the same
ExecQuery operation on IWbemServices interface pointer obtained from the server:

 + DCOM: WMI protocol Request, DCOM Version=5.7  Causality Id={8E2416FE-0A3F-42BE-A9B0-

In response to the method executed above, the server returns an IEnumWbemClassObject interface
pointer:

 - WMI: IWbemServices:ExecQuery Response, ReturnValue=WBEM_S_NO_ERROR
   + Enum: OBJREFSTANDARD - {027947E1-D731-11CE-A357-000000000001}
   + Pad: 2 Bytes
     ReturnValue: 0x00000000 - WBEM_S_NO_ERROR - Indicates a successful completion to the
method call.

The client uses IRemUnknown and IRemUnknown2, as specified in [MS-DCOM], to obtain an
IWbemFetchSmartEnum interface pointer from the IEnumWbemClassObject interface pointer. From
this the client knows whether the server is optimized:

Server responds with a valid IWbemFetchSmartEnum interface pointer. This means that the server is
optimized:

 - DCOM: IRemUnknown2:RemQueryInterface Response, ORPCFNULL - No additional information in

   + RemqiresultPtr: Pointer To 0x00020000
   + Size: 1 Elements
   + QueryInterfaceResults:

The client then calls the IWbemFetchSmartEnum::GetSmartEnum method to obtain the
IWbemWCOSmartEnum interface pointer:

 WMI: IWbemFetchSmartEnum:GetSmartEnum Request

Server responds with a valid IWbemWCOSmartEnum interface pointer:

 - WMI: IWbemFetchSmartEnum:GetSmartEnum Response, ReturnValue=WBEM_S_NO_ERROR

     Timeout: WBEM_NO_WAIT(Call returns immediately, regardless of whether any objects are
available.)
     UCount: 10 (0xA)

Server responds with the result set this time with no calc.exe instances. This proves that the
terminate method was called on win32_process object, and has terminated calc.exe instance on the
server:

On the server machine, the MOF shown below is compiled and made available to WMI.

 #pragma namespace("\\\\.\\root\\cimv2\\MyTest")
 Class TestWMI
 {
     [key] uint32 x;
     uint32 y;
 };

First the client tries to connect to the server and obtains IWbemServices interface pointer for
namespace root\cimv2\MyTest as outlined in 4.1.1. There is initially an instance of a TestWMI Class
created on the server with (x=3,y=5).

Client calls PutInstance operation on IWbemServices interface pointer to create another instance of
TestWMI class on the server. The instance property values are x=10, y=15:

 - WMI: IWbemServices:PutInstance Request, Flags=0
   + Inst: OBJREFCUSTOM - {DC12A681-737F-11CF-884D-00AA004B2E24}
     Pad: 0 Bytes
   + Flags: 0 (0x0)
   + Ctx: NULL
   + CallResult: NULL

Server returns WBEM_S_NO_ERROR. This implies that the instance above was successfully created on
the server:

 - WMI: IWbemServices:PutInstance Response, ReturnValue=WBEM_S_NO_ERROR
   + CallResult: NULL
     Pad: 0 Bytes
     ReturnValue: 0x00000000 - WBEM_S_NO_ERROR - Indicates a successful completion to the
method call.

Client calls CreateInstanceEnum operation on IWbemServices interface pointer:

 - WMI: IWbemServices:CreateInstanceEnum Request, Flags=33
   + StrFilter: TestWMI
   + Pad: 2 Bytes
   + Flags: 33 (0x21)
   + Ctx: NULL

In response to the method executed above, the server returns an IEnumWbemClassObject interface
pointer:

 - WMI: IWbemServices:CreateInstanceEnum Response, ReturnValue=WBEM_S_NO_ERROR
   + Enum: OBJREFSTANDARD - {027947E1-D731-11CE-A357-000000000001}
   + Pad: 2 Bytes
     ReturnValue: 0x00000000 - WBEM_S_NO_ERROR - Indicates a successful completion to the

### 4.3 Semisynchronous Operations

In semisynchronous cases, the call returns before the requested operation completes, and another
interface is used to retrieve the operation results. The returned interface depends on the
IWbemServices methods that are invoked by the client. The following sections describe the two
different behaviors.

#### 4.3.1 Semisynchronous Delivery of a Single Result

The methods returning a single element such as IWbemServices::OpenNamespace,
IWbemServices::GetObject, IWbemServices::PutClass, IWbemServices::DeleteClass,
IWbemServices::PutInstance, IWbemServices::DeleteInstance, or IWbemServices::ExecMethod return
an IWbemCallResult interface pointer. To obtain the operation results, the client uses the
IWbemCallResult methods.

<!-- /Extracted images from page 181 -->

Figure 17: Semisynchronous delivery of a single result

#### 4.3.2 Semisynchronous Delivery of Result Sets

The semisynchronous operation uses the same sequence as the synchronous calls, as specified in
section 4.2.2, to request a result set. However, in semisynchronous cases, the
IEnumWbemClassObject interface pointer is returned before the result set is available on the server.
This is different from the synchronous case, in which the interface pointer is returned only after the
result set is available on the server. The IEnumWbemClassObject interface pointer is returned before
the result set is available on the server. When the client calls the IEnumWbemClassObject::Next
method, it specifies a time-out within which the server returns the requested results. When one of the
previous conditions is satisfied, the call completes.

#### 4.3.3 Semisynchronous Delivery Traces

##### 4.3.3.1 Semisynchronous Delivery of IWbemServices ExecQuery and ExecMethod

##### 4.3.3.2 Semisynchronous Delivery of IWbemServices PutInstance, DeleteInstance,

and CreateInstanceEnum Operations

This section contains the information exchanged between SAI-NAV009 (client) and SAI-NAV009-2
(server). The MOF shown below is compiled on the server machine and is made available to WMI.

 #pragma namespace("\\\\.\\root\\cimv2\\MyTest")
 Class TestWMI
 {
     [key] uint32 x;
     uint32 y;
 };

There is initially an instance of TestWMI object created (x=3,y=5).

First the client tries to connect to the server and obtains IWbemServices interface pointer for
namespace root\cimv2\MyTest as outlined in 4.1.1.

Client calls PutInstance operation on IWbemServices interface pointer to create another instance of
TestWMI class on the server. The instance property values are x=10, y=15:

 - WMI: IWbemWCOSmartEnum:Next Response, PuReturned=0 BuffSize=0 ReturnValue=WBEM_S_FALSE
     PuReturned: 0 (0x0)
     BuffSize: 0 (0x0)
   + BufferPtrSize: Pointer To NULL
     Pad: 0 Bytes
     ReturnValue: 0x00000001 - WBEM_S_FALSE - Either no more CIM objects are available, the
number of returned CIM objects is less than the number requested, or this is the end of an
enumeration.

Server responds with a valid IWbemCallResult interface pointer corresponding to the PutInstance
operation above:

 - WMI: IWbemServices:PutInstance Response, ReturnValue=WBEM_S_NO_ERROR
   + CallResult: OBJREFSTANDARD - {44ACA675-E8FC-11D0-A07C-00C04FB68820}
   + Pad: 2 Bytes
     ReturnValue: 0x00000000 - WBEM_S_NO_ERROR - Indicates a successful completion to the
method call.

Client calls GetCallStatus on IWbemCallResult interface pointer to obtain the status of PutInstance
operation above:

     Timeout: 5000 ms(0x1388)

Server responds with ReturnValue WBEM_S_NO_ERROR, and the Status as S_OK. This implies that
the PutInstance operation above was successfully executed on the server:

 - WMI: IWbemCallResult:GetCallStatus Response, Status=0 ReturnValue=WBEM_S_NO_ERROR
     Status: 0 (0x0)
     ReturnValue: 0x00000000 - WBEM_S_NO_ERROR - Indicates a successful completion to the
method call.

Client calls GetResultObject method on IWbemCallResult interface pointer to get the result object:

Server responds with WBEM_S_NO_ERROR, and an instance of IWbemClassObject that contains the
return value from Client's PutInstance operation above:

 - DCOM: IRemUnknown2:RemRelease Response, ORPCFNULL - No additional information in this
packet
   + HeaderResp: ORPCFNULL - No additional information in this packet
   + ReturnValue: Success

Client calls CreateInstanceEnum operation on IWbemServices interface pointer:

 - WMI: IWbemServices:CreateInstanceEnum Request, Flags=49
   + StrFilter: tESTWMI
   + Pad: 2 Bytes
   + Flags: 49 (0x31)
   + Ctx: NULL

In response to the method executed above, the server returns an IEnumWbemClassObject interface
pointer:

 - WMI: IWbemServices:CreateInstanceEnum Response, ReturnValue=WBEM_S_NO_ERROR
   + Enum: OBJREFSTANDARD - {027947E1-D731-11CE-A357-000000000001}
   + Pad: 2 Bytes
     ReturnValue: 0x00000000 - WBEM_S_NO_ERROR - Indicates a successful completion to the
method call.

The client uses IEnumWbemClassObject interface pointer, as specified in [MS-DCOM], to obtain an
IWbemFetchSmartEnum interface pointer from the IEnumWbemClassObject interface pointer. From
this the client knows that the server is optimized:

     ReturnValue: 0x00000001 - WBEM_S_FALSE - Either no more CIM objects are available, the
number of returned CIM objects is less than the number requested, or this is the end of an

### 4.4 Asynchronous Delivery of Results

An asynchronous method returns before the requested operation completes. The server continues to
execute the request and delivers the results to the client using a response handler when the results
are available. The response handler receives the results as they become available. The
IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method is called by the server when a result is found during the
operation.

To make an asynchronous query, the client uses the IWbemServices interface pointer and it passes
the IWbemObjectSink interface when calling an asynchronous method of the IWbemServices interface.

If the asynchronous call returns SUCCESS, the server keeps a reference to the IWbemObjectSink
interface pointer. If the server is required to return WMI objects to the client, the server delivers the
results through the IWbemObjectSink::Indicate method.

After the delivery of all objects, the server makes a single call to IWbemObjectSink::SetStatus to
indicate that the operation finished, specifying the final status of the operation. After that, the server
releases the IWbemObjectSink pointer.

### 4.5 Optimized Asynchronous Delivery of Results

The asynchronous communication is optimized to reduce the network usage by making use of the
ObjectArray structure as specified in section 2.2.14.

A client supporting that capability notifies the server by returning 0x400FF (WBEM_S_NEW_STYLE) in
the first Indicate operation. A server that does not support the ObjectArray structure interprets this as
a success return code, while a server supporting the ObjectArray structure notices the code and sends
the rest of the results by using the ObjectArray structure, as specified in section 2.2.14.

### 4.6 Configuring Refreshing Services

When using the refresher mechanism, a client application that is connected to a remote computer
through an IWbemServices pointer uses the IRemUnknown and IRemUnknown2 interfaces, as
specified in [MS-DCOM], to obtain an IWbemRefreshingServices interface, and it adds CIM objects or
enumerators as needed. The following diagram illustrates this behavior.

### 4.7 Using the Refresher Interface

The IWbemRemoteRefresher interface pointer that is returned from IWbemRefreshingServices is
used to obtain an updated result set. For the usage of the remote refresher, the client calls the
IWbemRemoteRefresher::RemoteRefresh method when the client needs to get an updated set of data.

## 5 Security

The following sections specify security considerations for implementers of the Windows Management
Instrumentation Remote Protocol.

### 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

For all methods, the server MUST enforce that the DCOM security level is at least at the
RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT level, and SHOULD be at the RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT_INTEGRITY
level; the server MUST also evaluate the security principal rights to open a CIM namespace.<87>
The server MUST fail the operation if the security requirements are not met.

### 5.2 Index of Security Parameters

The server MUST secure access to each CIM namespace by using security descriptors<88> as
specified in [MS-DTYP].

The server MUST use the DCOM identity of the caller against the security descriptor of the namespace
to grant or deny the access.

The access mask that controls the security principal rights contains the following specific rights,
which are interpreted as specified in the table.

Constants

Value

Meaning

WBEM_ENABLE

WBEM_FULL_WRITE

0x1

0x4

Grants the security principal read permissions.

Grants the security principal to write to classes and instances.

WBEM_METHOD_EXECUTE

0x2

Grants the security principal to execute methods.

WBEM_PARTIAL_WRITE_REP  0x8

Grants the security principal to update or delete CIM instances that
are static.

WBEM_REMOTE_ENABLE

0x20

Grants the security principal to remotely access the server.

WBEM_WRITE_PROVIDER

0x10

Grants the security principal to update or delete CIM instances that
are dynamic.

READ_CONTROL

0x20000  Allows the security principal to read the security descriptor of CIM

namespace.

WRITE_DAC

0x40000  Allows the security principal to modify the security descriptor of CIM

namespace.

In order to change the namespace security descriptor, a client MUST use the Windows Management
Instrumentation Remote Protocol and the required CIM object encoding, as specified in [MS-WMIO].
To query or change the security descriptor, the __SystemSecurity class methods GetSD and SetSD
defined in section 2.2.30 MUST be used. To manage the namespace security, the __SystemSecurity
class MUST be implemented at the top level of every namespace. The GetSD and SetSD methods are
invoked as specified in sections 3.1.4.3.22 and 3.1.4.3.23.

If the event object that is delivered to the WMI server (as specified in 3.2.4.2.1) contains a non-null
SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR as specified in 2.2.4.2, the server MUST secure access to the event object by
using access controls specified in the security descriptor. The access mask that controls the security
principal rights has the following specific rights, which are interpreted as specified in the following
table.

Constants

Value  Meaning

WBEM_RIGHTS_PUBLISH

0x80

Grants the security principal permission to send events to the WMI server
as specified in 3.2.4.2.1.

WBEM_RIGHT_SUBSCRIBE  0x40

Grants the security principal permission to receive the event object using
the IWbemServices::ExecNotificationQuery or
IWbemServices::ExecNotificationQueryAsync method call. If this
permission is not granted, the client can make
IWbemServices::ExecNotificationQuery or
IWbemServices::ExecNotificationQueryAsync calls, but the event is not
delivered.

## 7 Appendix B: Product Behavior

The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental
software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

The terms "earlier" and "later", when used with a product version, refer to either all preceding
versions or all subsequent versions, respectively. The term "through" refers to the inclusive range of
versions. Applicable Microsoft products are listed chronologically in this section.

Windows Client

  Windows NT 4.0 operating system

  Windows 2000 Professional operating system

  Windows XP operating system

  Windows XP 64-Bit Edition operating system

  Windows Vista operating system

  Windows 7 operating system

  Windows 8 operating system

  Windows 8.1 operating system

also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the
product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed
using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the
SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the
product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 2.2.6: The prefix "__" is specific to Windows and is not a CIM standard.

<2> Section 2.2.12: Windows interprets the flags as follows:

WBEM_FLAG_CONNECT_REPOSITORY_ONLY: The connection is established to operate only on
the static data (classes and instances) stored in the CIM database. Operations requiring a
provider will not be supported on this connection.

WBEM_FLAG_CONNECT_PROVIDERS: The connection is established to operate only on the

provider.

<3> Section 2.2.13: A Windows client builds the IWbemContext object by using a set of specific
IWbemContext methods to add, delete, and enumerate properties with their respective values. The
IWbemContext methods are not used by the protocol at any time. They are used internally by the
client and the server to manage the content of the object.

The following Windows versions support the context properties in the table: Windows XP operating
system Service Pack 1 (SP1), Windows Server 2003 operating system with Service Pack 1 (SP1),
Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system.
Prior versions of Windows ignore these values.

<4> Section 2.2.13.4: 32-bit versions of Windows set the value to 4; however, 64-bit versions of
Windows set the value to 8.

<5> Section 2.2.13.4: 32-bit versions of Windows set the value to 4; however, 64-bit versions of
Windows set the value to 8.

<6> Section 2.2.14:  This optimization technique is being used by Windows starting with Windows XP
and Windows Server 2003.

<7> Section 2.2.21: Windows uses the m_dwProcessId as the process identifier.

<8> Section 2.2.30.1: Windows 2000 Professional and later and Windows Server 2003 and later do
not return errors using the return value of the GetSD CIM method. Errors are returned as an error in
the IWbemServices interface method call.

<9> Section 2.2.30.2: Windows 2000 Professional and later and Windows Server 2003 and later do
not return errors using the return value of the GetSD CIM method. Errors are returned as an error in
the IWbemServices interface method call.

<10> Section 2.2.30.3: On Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server,
Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows XP SP1, the RequiresEncryption qualifier is
ignored.

<11> Section 2.2.32: In Windows, the security descriptor of a namespace can be specified explicitly in
an MOF file, using the NamespaceSecuritySDDL qualifier. The qualifier is a string in the security
descriptor definition language (SDDL) format. If no NamespaceSecuritySDDL qualifier is present, the
server initializes the security descriptor for the namespace to the default value.

<12> Section 3.1.1: In Windows, the limit is 5000.

<13> Section 3.1.1: In Windows, the security descriptor of a namespace can be specified explicitly in
an MOF file, using the NamespaceSecuritySDDL qualifier. The qualifier is a string in the security

descriptor definition language (SDDL) format. If no NamespaceSecuritySDDL qualifier is present, the
server initializes the security descriptor for the namespace to the default value.

The security groups refer to the values defined in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2.4.

Starting with Windows Vista, the default security groups are:

  AUTHENTICATED_USERS



LOCAL_SERVICE

  NETWORK_SERVICE

  BUILTIN_ADMINISTRATORS

In Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, and
Windows NT 4.0, the default security groups are:

  BUILTIN_ADMINISTRATORS



LOCAL_SERVICE

  NETWORK_SERVICE



EVERYONE

The default access permissions for the AUTHENTICATED_USERS, LOCAL_SERVICE, and
NETWORK_SERVICE are:

  WBEM_METHOD_EXECUTE

  WBEM_FULL_WRITE

  WBEM_ENABLE

<14> Section 3.1.1: "WQL:References" is used in Windows NT Server, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows
2000 Server only.

<15> Section 3.1.1.1.3: Windows does not send progress information.

<16> Section 3.1.1.1.3: Windows tries to make the call at the highest authentication level,
RPC_C_AUTHN_PKT_PRIVACY. If UnsecAppAccessControlDefault is set to false, Windows gradually
downgrades (decreasing the authentication level by one level at every call) to RPC_C_AUTHN_NONE if
the DCOM Remote Protocol (as specified in [MS-DCOM]) is unable to use the current authentication
level. The minimum authentication level for Windows 2000 Professional and Windows 2000 Server is
RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT. In Windows 2000 Professional and Windows 2000 Server, Windows
XP, and Windows Server 2003, the server does not check for the AllowAnonymousCallback flag prior
to making anonymous callbacks to the client.

In Windows Vista and later and Windows Server 2008 and later, the AllowAnonymousCallback value
will be retrieved from registry location
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WBEM\CIMOM\AllowAnonymousCallback. In Windows 2000 Professional
and Windows XP, the server does not check for the UnsecAppAccessControlDefault flag prior to
downgrading the authentication level.

In Windows Server 2003 and later and Windows Vista and later, the UnsecAppAccessControlDefault
value will be retrieved from registry location
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WBEM\CIMOM\UnsecAppAccessControlDefault.

<17> Section 3.1.3: In Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, Windows XP, and Windows
Server 2003, this value is set to True.

<18> Section 3.1.4: The following Windows versions support ordered array types:

  Windows NT operating system

  Windows NT 4.0

  Windows XP 64-Bit Edition

<19> Section 3.1.4: Windows secures the access to each namespace and accepts only authenticated
calls made at least at the RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT level. Windows behavior across different
operating systems is specified in the following table.

Operating system version

Minimum authentication level

Windows NT

RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT

Windows 2000 operating system

RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_CONNECT

Windows 2000 Professional operating system Service Pack 3 (SP3)  RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT

Windows XP

Windows Server 2003

Windows Vista

RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT

RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT

RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT

<20> Section 3.1.4: Windows NT Server and Windows NT 4.0 do not allow the static properties to be
modified.

<21> Section 3.1.4: Windows allows providers to do the impersonation or do additional authentication
and authorization checks based on the security principal of the caller.

<22> Section 3.1.4: On Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and
Windows XP SP1, the RequiresEncryption qualifier is ignored.

<23> Section 3.1.4: In Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, if the number of active
IWbemService objects for root\virtualization namespace is more than 4096, the server returns
WBEM_E_QUOTA_VIOLATION.

<24> Section 3.1.4:  Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows
Server 2008, and Windows 7 do not use this.

<25> Section 3.1.4:  Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows
Server 2008, and Windows 7 do not use this.

<26> Section 3.1.4: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows
Server 2008, and Windows 7 do not set this option. Windows 8 and later and Windows Server 2012
and later set this option when WMI C-Client APIs are used but not when the IWbemServices COM
interface is used.

<27> Section 3.1.4.1.1: If the server accepts as a locale parameter for the
IWbemLevel1Login::NTLMLogin method all locales valid for Windows Vista as defined in Appendix A of
[MS-LCID], the server returns WBEM_S_NO_ERROR for IWbemLevel1Login::EstablishPosition.

<28> Section 3.1.4.1.1: If the server returns WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER for any valid Windows
Vista locales as specified in Appendix A of [MS-LCID] that has been passed as a locale parameter to
the IWbemLevel1Login::NTLMLogin method while all other parameters are valid, the server returns
E_NOTIMPL for IWbemLevel1Login::EstablishPosition.

<29> Section 3.1.4.1.4: In Windows, it is the Windows system locale of the server.

<30> Section 3.1.4.1.4: Windows 2000 and later and Windows XP and later fail the call and return
0x80041008 (WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER) if the locale name does not match one of the WMI
Locale Formats (section 2.2.29), or if the locale name is not valid for that operating system.

If the locale name is in the "MS_xxx" format but refers to an LCID, Windows Vista and later and
Windows Server 2008 and later fail the call and return 0x80070057 (E_INVALIDARG).

If the locale is in "MS_xxx" format as defined in section 2.2.29 and the LCID is not valid for Windows
7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, or Windows Server 2012, Windows fails the call and returns
E_INVALIDARG. If the locale string is not in "MS_xxx" format and it is not a valid locale for Windows 7
and later and Windows Server 2008 R2 and later, the locale is ignored.

<31> Section 3.1.4.1.4: Windows clients always set lFlags to 0. The server role of Windows 2000
returns WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER for a nonzero value of lFlags. The server roles of Windows XP
and later and Windows Server 2003 and later allow lFlags to be 0 or any combination of the flags
WBEM_FLAG_CONNECT_PROVIDERS and WBEM_FLAG_CONNECT_REPOSITORY_ONLY.

<32> Section 3.1.4.1.4: The following Windows client versions do not enforce a limit:

  Windows NT 4.0

  Windows NT Server 4.0 operating system

  Windows 2000 Professional

  Windows 2000 Server

  Windows XP

  Windows XP SP1

  Windows XP operating system Service Pack 2 (SP2)

  Windows Server 2003

  Windows Server 2003 with SP1

The following versions of Windows enforce a query string limit of 8173 characters (WBEM_MAX_PATH
-19, where WBEM_MAX_PATH = 0x2000 and the 19 characters represent the length of the string
__namespace.name=""):

  Windows Server 2003 SP2 and later

  Windows Vista and later

<33> Section 3.1.4.1.4: Windows uses the system's locale as described in [MSDN-
GetSystemDefaultLangID].

<34> Section 3.1.4.3.6: Windows does not ignore the amended qualifiers while it creates a CIM
class; however, it does ignore all the amended qualifiers while it updates a class. Because the
amended qualifiers are not ignored while Windows creates a CIM class, when this CIM class is
retrieved by using IWbemServices::GetObject or IWbemServices::GetObjectAsync (retrieved even
without using the WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS flag), the returned class contains
amended qualifiers.

<35> Section 3.1.4.3.6: Windows client versions Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 Professional,
Windows XP, and server versions Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows Server
2003, and Windows Server 2003 with SP1 do not enforce a limit.

<36> Section 3.1.4.3.7: Windows does not ignore the amended qualifiers while it creates a CIM class;
however, it does ignore all the amended qualifiers while it updates a class. Because the amended
qualifiers are not ignored while Windows creates a CIM class, when this CIM class is retrieved by using
IWbemServices::GetObject or IWbemServices::GetObjectAsync (retrieved even without using the
WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS flag), the returned class contains amended qualifiers.

<56> Section 3.1.4.8.1: Applicable Windows Server releases record lClientProcId for debugging
purposes.

<57> Section 3.1.4.9.1: A WMI server in Windows 2000 and Windows XP signals a Windows kernel
event with the specified name. The valid values for the sEventToSet parameter of
IWbemLoginHelper::SetEvent are all the valid values for the lpName parameter to the OpenEvent
function, as defined in [MSDN-OpenEvent]. If the client can detect that the event is set at the end of
the IWbemLoginHelper::SetEvent method call, the client identifies that the server is running in the
same server. If the client and server are running on different machines, the Windows event by the
specified name will not be set on the client machine, and the client can then identify that the server is
running on another machine.

<58> Section 3.1.4.10.1: Applicable Windows Server releases require an absolute file path that starts
with a drive letter.

<59> Section 3.1.4.10.1: Windows allows users that have the SE_BACKUP_PRIVILEGE privilege to
perform the backup operation.

<60> Section 3.1.4.10.2: Applicable Windows Server releases require an absolute file path that starts

<61> Section 3.1.4.10.2: Windows allows users that have the SE_RESTORE_PRIVILEGE privilege to
perform the restore operation.

<62> Section 3.1.4.11: This interface is not supported in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.

<63> Section 3.1.4.12: The IWbemRefreshingServices interface is not available in Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 2000, or Windows 2000 Server.

<64> Section 3.1.4.12.1: Windows 2000 sets the version number to 1.

<65> Section 3.1.4.12.2: Windows 2000 sets the version number to 1.

<69> Section 3.1.4.12.5: Windows 2000 sets the version number to 1.

<70> Section 3.1.4.12.6: Windows 2000 sets the version number to 1.

<71> Section 3.1.4.13: The IWbemRemoteRefresher interface is not available in Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 2000, or Windows 2000 Server.

<72> Section 3.1.4.13.3: The Opnum5NotUsedOnWire method is not used by Windows and therefore
is not required for an implementation.

<73> Section 3.1.4.17:  Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows

<74> Section 3.1.4.17:  Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows
Server 2008, and Windows 7 do not use this.

<75> Section 3.1.4.17.11: In Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows
Server 2008, the default is IN when IN/IN,OUT/OUT is not specified for a method parameter.

<76> Section 3.1.4.18.1: Windows initializes the security descriptor for the namespace to the
following values.

Starting with Windows Vista, the default security groups are:

  Authenticated Users



LOCAL SERVICE

  NETWORK SERVICE

  Administrators (on the local computer)

In Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0, the default security
groups are:

  Administrators



LOCAL SERVICE

  NETWORK SERVICE



Everyone

The default access permissions for the Authenticated Users, LOCAL SERVICE, and NETWORK SERVICE
are:

<77> Section 3.2.3: Windows clients pass the client process ID in the lClientProcId parameter.

<78> Section 3.2.3: Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients obtain the IWbemLoginHelper interface
by using the IRemUnknown and IRemUnknown2 interfaces, as specified in [MS-DCOM] sections
3.1.1.5.6 and 3.1.1.5.7, on the IWbemLevel1Login interface.

If the server returns an error during the attempt to use IRemUnknown and IRemUnknown2 to obtain
an IWbemLoginHelper interface, the client ignores the error. The client calls
IWbemLoginHelper::SetEvent to determine whether both the client and server are running on the
same machine.

The valid values for the sEventToSet parameter of IWbemLoginHelper::SetEvent are all the valid
values for the lpName parameter to the OpenEvent function as defined in [MSDN-OpenEvent]. If the
client can detect that the event is set at the end of the IWbemLoginHelper::SetEvent method call, the
client can identify that both the client and server are running on the same machine. If the client and
server are running on different machines, the Windows event by the specified name is not set on the
client machine, and the client can then identify that the server is running on another machine.

<79> Section 3.2.3: If the return value from IWbemLevel1Login::EstablishPosition is
WBEM_S_NO_ERROR and LocaleVersion is set to 0, the client filters out locale lists that are not
supported in Windows Vista, as specified in [MS-LCID].

<80> Section 3.2.4: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows
Server 2008, and Windows 7 do not set the option. Windows 8 does set the option when WMI C-Client
APIs are used but not when the IWbemServices COM interface is used.

<81> Section 3.2.4.1.1: Windows attempts to batch object delivery. The algorithm is complex;
however, the maximum batch size, in bytes, can be set by editing the registry value for
FinalizerBatchSize under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wbem\CIMOM registry
subkey. If FinalizerBatchSize is not specified, the default value, 262144 (0x40000), is used.

<82> Section 3.2.4.1.2: Windows does not send progress information.

<83> Section 4.2.2: In this context, unoptimized client behavior is client behavior in Windows 2000
and Windows 2000 Server.

<84> Section 4.2.2: In this context, optimized client behavior is client behavior in the following
Windows versions:

  Windows XP 64-Bit Edition

## 9 Appendix D: Enumerating Class Schema

The following script shows how to enumerate the current class schemas on a Windows machine:

 EnumerateSchema "root"

 sub EnumerateSchema(ns)
      if instr(ns,"LDAP") = 0 then
                              wscript.echo "#pragma namespace(""\\\\.\\" & escapeit(ns) &
""")"
      set wmi = getobject("winmgmts:\\.\" & ns)
      for each cls in wmi.subclassesof("")
              wscript.echo cls.getobjecttext_(0)
      next

      for each subns in wmi.instancesof("__namespace")
              EnumerateSchema ns & "\" & subns.name
      next
      end if
 end sub

 function escapeit(ns)
      escapeit = replace(ns, "\", "\\")
 end function

To use the script:

1.  Save the script as "getmofs.vbs" on the target machine.

2.  From a cmd.exe window, type "cscript getmofs.vbs > schema.mof". On Windows versions that
support the Windows Integrity Mechanism, including the Windows Vista operating system and
later versions, the CMD window is required to be "elevated", that is, run with administrative
privileges.

The resulting output (in schema.mof) represents all of the class schemas on the particular system.

1  Introduction

1.1  Conceptual Overview

Both the client and server versions of Windows implement standard authentication protocols as part of
an extensible architecture that consists of security support provider (SSP) security packages. These
protocols include Kerberos, Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Simple and Protected Generic
Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO), and
their extensions, as specified in [MS-KILE], [MS-TLSP], [MS-SPNG], and [MS-NEGOEX] respectively.

These protocols enable the authentication of users, computers, and services. The authentication
process, in turn, enables authorized users and services to access resources securely.

Windows networking has its roots in the LAN Manager (LM) network product. LM was designed for a
time when client authentication was sufficient for most requirements, and when the algorithms
common at the time exceeded computational capacity. For example, exhaustively searching Data
Encryption Standard (DES) keys was unthinkable by any but the most dedicated government
resources. LM authentication used a straightforward challenge/response authentication and was
sufficient for many customers for many years.

When Microsoft adopted the Kerberos protocol for Windows and moved away from NT LAN Manager
(NTLM) Protocol, the decision required a substantial change for a number of protocols. This process
is still going on today. Rather than repeat the process when circumstances required a new or
additional security protocol, Microsoft chose to insert a protocol, in this case, SPNEGO, to allow
security protocol selection and extension.

1.1.1  Authentication Concepts

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of an entity. Several types of identities exist in
Windows, and they are managed in several ways. For example, identity can refer to the set of users
on a single computer or to the identities that are available in a domain.

1.1.1.1  Security Principal

The security principal is an entity with an identity that can be authenticated. A security principal is a
common concept in security; it is an actor in a security system and can often initiate action. Typically,
a security principal is associated with a human user of the computer system, but it can also be an
autonomous program within the system, such as a logging daemon, a system backup program, or a
network application. In Windows a security principal typically is a user, but also can be a computer, a
service, or a security group that represents a set of users. When authenticating a user, the goal is to
verify that the user is not an imposter. When authenticating an entity, such as a computer or a
network service, the goal is to verify that the entity is genuine.

Security principals receive permissions to access resources such as files and folders. User rights, such
as interactive logons, are granted or denied to accounts directly or through membership in a group.
The accumulation of these permissions and rights defines what security principals can and cannot do
when working on the network.

An identity is associated with a key. If a client proves knowledge of the key to a server, the server
treats that associated identity as the identity of the client. A security principal is often referred to as
an account. The identity that Windows uses for an account is called a security identifier (SID).

1.1.1.2  Accounts

On a computer that is running Windows, an account represents a security principal. The security
principal (or account) has at least a name and an identifier.

The name is a simple textual name for the account and can be a personal name, such as Rene Valdes,
SYSTEM, or RedmondDc1$. However, the name is merely an attribute of the account and can change
over time. A common scenario for a name change is when the person to whom the account refers
changes his or her name.

Also, the name is treated as case-insensitive. That is, Rene Valdes, RENE VALDEZ, rene valdes, and
reNe ValdEZ are treated as equivalent in Windows. Microsoft views case-sensitivity as an unnecessary
burden on the administrator that can lead to mistakes.

The identifier, although also an attribute of the account, needs to satisfy other requirements as well.
Of particular importance are the uniqueness and persistence of the identifier and the ability to identify
the issuer of the identifier.

The persistence of the identifier provides the administrator the capability to assign a resource to that
account and the capacity to accept future changes to the account.

For example, an administrator might assign a user who is named Rene Valdes access to a certain
document at some point in time. If Rene Valdes leaves the company and a different Rene Valdes is
hired, the new Rene Valdes is not to have access to the resources of the original Rene Valdes.
Conversely, if Rene Valdes changes his name to Rene Q. Valdes, he is not to lose access to the
resources that was previously granted to him.

The ability to identify the issuer of an identifier is important because it can determine whether a party
is willing to accept the identifier. For example, in the physical world, a cashier generally accepts a
driver's license as proof of identity, but the cashier refuses to accept a gymnasium membership card.
In Windows, the issuer of an account is encoded with the identity so that any recipient can make a
similar decision.

Windows has two basic accounts: user accounts and computer accounts. (The built-in administrator
account is enabled by default, except in the Windows 7 operating system):

User account: Identifies users who belong to a domain. User accounts store the names of users,

information that is required to verify their identity, and other user information.

Computer account: Identifies computers that belong to a domain. A computer account is commonly
referred to as a "machine account". Every Windows computer that joins a domain has a computer
account. Computer accounts provide a means for authenticating and auditing computer access to
the network and to domain resources. Each computer account is unique.

For more information about user and computer accounts, see Active Directory naming [MSFT-ADN].

Windows supports two distinct methods for machine logon. An interactive logon is the process in
which the account information and credentials that the user enters interactively are authenticated by
a domain controller (DC), whereas a network logon is the process of making an authenticated
connection to a server across the network.

Authentication methods range from a simple logon, which identifies users based on information that
only the user knows, like a password, to more powerful security mechanisms that use something that
the user has, like tokens, public key certificates, and biometrics. In a business environment, users
might access multiple applications on many types of servers within a single location or across multiple
locations. For these reasons, authentication methods need to support heterogeneous environments.

For network logon, the authenticating entities are called the client and the server. They are separate
processes or programs that run on one or more computers. When the client/server computing
paradigm was initially designed and adopted, the clients and servers usually communicated over
secure self-contained networks. As more and more applications had to communicate over open
nonsecure interconnected networks such as the Internet, the chances that message data could be
intercepted, altered, or suppressed increased significantly. Therefore, authentication protocols also
typically support the exchange of session keys that are used to protect the messages.

The client, the server, or both can be authenticated. Client authentication occurs when the client
proves its identity to the server; server authentication occurs when the server proves its identity to
the client.

An example of server authentication is the use of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) on the Internet,
which assures the identity of the server to the client. An example of client authentication might be the
authentication of a client in a protected network environment where all valuable resources reside on a
single server, and the server is concerned only about the identity of the client. On modern networks,
however, proving the identity of both the client and the server is critical. The client needs to be
assured of the identity of the server to avoid divulging important information to a rogue server. The
server has to be assured of the identity of the client to avoid granting the client inappropriate access.
This process is referred to as mutual authentication.

Ultimately, authentication is performed by using cryptographic operations of some form, such as
encryption or signatures. There are two main types of encryption: symmetric encryption and
asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a
message. Asymmetric encryption uses one key to encrypt and uses a different key to decrypt; these
keys are linked by mathematical requirements. Symmetric signatures can be implemented through
keyed hashes; asymmetric signatures can be implemented through encrypted hashes. See
[SCHNEIER] for more details.

Multitier client/server applications present a special situation for the Kerberos protocol. In this kind of
application, a client might connect to a front-end server that connects to a second server on the back
end. In this scenario, the front-end server sometimes authenticates itself to the back-end server by
getting a service ticket for the back-end server by using the invoking client's identity. Ideally, this
service ticket limits the front-end server's access on the second server to what the client is authorized
to do, rather than to what the front-end server is authorized to do.

The Kerberos protocol deals with this situation through a mechanism called delegation of
authentication. Essentially, the client delegates authentication to a server by communicating to the
Key Distribution Center (KDC) that the server is authorized to represent the client.

Similar to Kerberos delegation, the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) Protocol [MS-
CSSP] enables applications to securely delegate a user's credentials from the client to the target
server. However, it does so by using a completely different mechanism with different usability and
security characteristics. Unlike Kerberos delegation, the CredSSP Protocol requires prompting for user
credentials when a policy specifies their delegation. This difference means that the user has some
control over whether the delegation occurs and, more importantly, which credentials are used. With
Kerberos delegation, only the user's Active Directory credentials can be delegated.

The CredSSP Protocol is used only in scenarios where other delegation schemes such as Kerberos
delegation cannot be used; for example, in non-domain scenarios.

In one such scenario, the Microsoft Terminal Server uses the CredSSP Protocol to securely delegate
the user's password or smart card PIN from the client to the server to log on a network user and
establish a Terminal Services session.

1.1.1.3  Domain Membership

Domain membership is the state of trusting a third party, the domain controller, for identity and
authentication information. Any computer can be part of a domain. Windows computers are easily
configured to be part of a domain and to trust the domain controller for many tasks. Also, certain
configuration changes are made, such as accepting the domain as the authoritative source of time.

Joining a domain can be summarized as (1) establishing an account on the domain that represents the
computer joining the domain, and (2) setting the password (or key) for the account on both the
domain and the computer. In Windows, this process is encapsulated in a domain join function called
NetJoinDomain. Several tools, including WinBind, exist for non-Windows systems to join a Windows
domain.

In Windows, the Netlogon component manages the relationship with the domain controller. Netlogon
maintains the keys that are necessary for ongoing authentication of the member system to the
domain controller. It also creates a secure channel to the Netlogon instance on the domain controller.
This channel that Netlogon creates for authentication is not specific to any protocol and is available
only to components that are involved in authentication.

Various authentication protocol implementations use this channel to redirect an authentication request
to their instance on the domain controller or to augment their activities with their instance on the
domain controller.

When the Netlogon service that runs on a client computer connects to the Netlogon service on a
domain controller to authenticate a user, the Netlogon services challenge each other to determine
whether they both have a valid computer account. This allows a secure communication channel to be
established for logon purposes.

1.1.1.4  Groups

A group is a collection of user accounts, computer accounts, and other groups, all of which are called
group members. A group has a name and an identifier. Group membership can either be specified in
Active Directory or be local to a particular computer.

Except on Windows NT operating system and Windows 2000 Server operating system, all applicable
Windows Server releases have several built-in security groups that are preconfigured with the
appropriate rights and permissions to perform specific tasks. Starting with Windows 2000 operating
system, Windows provides two types of groups:

Security groups: These groups contain members and can be granted permissions to control access
to network resources. Security groups can contain users, other groups, and even computers.

Distribution groups: These groups are used for nonsecurity functions, such as grouping users

together to send email messages. Unlike security groups, these groups cannot be used to control
access to network resources.

1.1.1.4.1 Group Scope

The scope of a group can be local or global depending on the portion of the network in which the
group is granted rights and permissions. Starting with Windows 2000, Windows provides four levels of
scope for security groups:

Universal groups: These groups can contain members for any domain and can be granted

permissions to resources in any domain in a specific Active Directory forest. An Active Directory
forest is a collection of one or more Active Directory domains that share a common logical
structure, directory schema, and network configuration, as well as automatic two-way transitive
trust relationships. Each forest is a single instance of the directory and defines a security
boundary. For more information, see How Domains and Forests Work [MSFT-DomainForest].
Universal groups can contain user accounts, global groups, and universal groups from any domain
in the current forest. An administrator can create a universal group only when the domain is in
native mode and not in mixed mode.

Domain global groups: These groups contain members only from their own domain but can be

granted permissions to resources in any trusting domain. In Windows NT, global groups are
created on DCs and exist in the domain directory database.

Domain local groups: These groups can contain members from any trusted domain, but are granted
permissions only to resources in their own domain. A domain administrator can create a domain
local group for each resource that exists within a domain, such as file shares or printers, and then
add the appropriate global groups from each domain to this domain local group. The domain
administrator then assigns the appropriate permissions for the resources to the domain local
group.

Local groups: A local group can exist only within the local security database of the computer where it

is created. A local group can contain user accounts that are local to the computer and user
accounts and global groups from their own domain. This allows the member system to manage its
resources in the manner most relevant to it and not be completely dependent on the decisions of
the domain administrator. A local group can be granted permissions to resources only on the
computer where the local group was created. The Local Users and Groups Microsoft Management
Console (MMC) is used to create local groups on a computer.

A local group that is created with Windows NT Workstation operating system can be granted
permissions only to resources on the computer where it was created. A local group that is created
with a Windows NT Server operating system DC can be granted permissions only to resources on
the DCs of its own domain. Network administrators of enterprise-level Windows NT networks can
use a resource-access strategy called AGLP to plan and implement local groups in their network.
AGLP organizes accounts by placing them in global groups, which are then placed in local groups
that have appropriate permissions and rights assigned to them.

Beginning with Windows 2000 Server, the scope of a group can be changed. For example, global
groups that are not members of other global groups can be converted to universal groups. Domain
local groups that do not contain other domain local groups can be converted to universal groups.

1.1.1.4.2 Nested Groups

Windows supports the concept of nested groups, or the addition of groups to other groups. The use of
nested groups can help reduce the number of permissions that are required to be individually assigned
to users or groups.

The extent to which an organization uses nesting depends on which mode the domain controller was
configured in the operating system. Domain controllers can be configured in two modes: mixed mode
or native mode. For more information, see [MS-ADTS] section 6.1.4.1.

Mixed mode: A domain controller that is configured to support a mixed environment, meaning that

the environment can contain DCs running on Windows NT 4.0 operating system as well as DCs
running on Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003 operating system, and Windows Server 2003 R2
operating system.

Native mode: A domain controller that is not configured to support an environment that contains DCs
running on Windows NT 4.0. When the domain is in native mode, domain local groups can also
contain domain local groups from their own domain and universal groups from any trusted
domain.

Unlike Windows NT local groups, a domain local group can be granted permissions to resources on all
servers (both the domain controllers and member servers) in its domain. When the domain is in mixed
mode, domain local groups can contain user accounts and global groups from any trusted domain or
forest.

In mixed mode, only one type of nesting is available; global groups can be members of domain local
groups. Universal groups do not exist in mixed mode. In native mode, multiple levels of nesting are
available. The nesting rules for group membership are summarized in the following table.

1.1.1.5  Account Domains

Accounts are always created relative to an issuing authority, which is responsible for allocating and
assigning the SID. In Windows, the issuing authority is referred to as a domain. A domain is either a
local domain or extends across a network.

Domains store information about their accounts in an account database.

Windows uses Active Directory as the account database in domain-based environments, whereas
environments that are not domain-based use the security account manager (SAM) built-in
database as the account database.

1.1.1.5.1 Local Domains and Account Database

Every computer that runs Windows has its own local domain; that is, it has an account database for
accounts that are specific to that computer. Conceptually, this is an account database like any other
with accounts, groups, SIDs, and so on. These are referred to as local accounts, local groups, and so
on. Because computers typically do not trust each other for account information, these identities stay
local to the computer on which they were created.

The Security Account Manager (SAM) Remote Protocol (Client-to-Server) [MS-SAMR] exposes this
account database, for both the local domain and domains across a network. This protocol specifies the
behavior for the local domain and domains across a network by defining a common data model,
Active Directory, as specified in [MS-ADTS].

In a domain controller configuration, the data manipulated by the server of this protocol is stored in
Active Directory and is replicated by the replication protocol specified in [MS-DRSR], made available
through the LDAP interface specified in [MS-ADTS] section 3.1.1.3, and replicated by the NETLOGON
replication interface specified in [MS-NRPC]. The data manipulated by the server of this protocol is
used as a security principal database for authentication protocols such as NTLM [MS-NLMP] and
Kerberos [MS-KILE].

The abstract data model for the SAM Remote Protocol (Client-to-Server) that exposes the account
database is specified in [MS-SAMR] sections 3.1 and 3.2.

1.1.1.5.2 Network Domains and Domain Controllers

In a network domain, all applicable Windows Server releases can be configured to be domain
controllers. A domain controller is a server that has made its account database available to other
machines in a controlled manner.

Because the account database is typically distributed across multiple domain controllers, there can be
a mix of different versions of the individual servers. Active Directory defines a functional level, which
serves as a version level for the entire directory. For more information about functional levels, see
[MSFT-ADDSFL].

A domain has built-in groups that are defined by Microsoft and created in the domain during
installation. For example, built-in groups include the Domain Users, Domain Computers, and Domain
Admins groups. By default, the Domain Users group includes all users who are defined in the domain.

A domain controller accepts authentication requests on behalf of the machines that have chosen to
trust it and for accounts in its domain.

A domain controller can have peers within the domain, which are other servers that also have been
configured to host this account database. Any server that participates in the domain as a domain
controller might or might not allow changes; the configuration is a choice of the administrator.

When a change is allowed, the servers replicate the change so that all domain controllers have the
same information.

1.1.1.5.3 Effect on Accounts

Windows domains affect the way that accounts and groups work. Some of this is by convention, and
some is by design.

  By convention, when a Windows operating system is added to a domain, the domain

administrators group is made a member of the local administrators group.

  By design, groups have different scopes when domains are involved. Groups are defined as either
globally known (and therefore usable by other domains) or known only within the domain in which
they are defined.

1.1.2  Pre-GSS Authentication

For the initial generation of client-server computing, applications and authentication protocols were
tightly coupled. Authentication was hardwired into each application or into each security module, and
both were closely tied to the operating system and the communications transport layer.

This application-specific design increased development and maintenance costs and impeded
interoperability between applications that were running on the same or different communications
networks.

1.1.3  GSS-Style Authentication

In the 1990s, a new paradigm decoupled application protocols from authentication protocols. This
approach, which became the Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API),
simplified the interactions between the application protocols and authentication protocols. The
Generic Security Services (GSS) style or GSS model underlies most currently implemented
authentication protocols that interact directly with application protocols. In the GSS style or model,
the authentication protocol produces opaque messages that are known as security tokens. The
application protocol is responsible for security token exchange between sender and receiver but does
not parse or interpret the security tokens.

Client-side requests and server responses usually drive GSS authentication.

The Authentication Services protocols provide authentication services to client and server applications.
As illustrated in the following diagram, client and server applications interact with the Authentication
Client and Authentication Server components of Authentication Services. Additionally, the client
and server applications communicate directly with their counterparts.

Figure 1: GSS-style authentication model

As shown in the preceding diagram, the client application contacts the local Authentication Client
through a generic interface that abstracts the underlying authentication protocols for creating a
security token. The Authentication Client creates a security token with the help of the underlying
authentication protocols and returns it to the calling application. Next, the client application embeds
the security token within application messages of the application protocol and transmits them as an
authentication request to the server side of the application. On receipt of the authentication messages,
the server application extracts the security token and supplies it to the Authentication Server. The
Authentication Server processes the security token with the help of the underlying authentication
protocols and generates a response or determines that authentication is complete. If another security
token is generated, the server-side application sends it back to the client, where the process
continues.

This exchange of security tokens continues until one or both sides determine that authentication is
complete. If authentication fails, the application should drop the connection and indicate the error. If it
succeeds, the application can then be assured of the identity of the participants, as far as the
underlying authentication protocol can accomplish.

When authentication is complete, session-specific security services are available. The application can
then invoke the authentication protocol to sign or encrypt the messages that are sent as part of the
application protocol. These operations are performed in much the same way, where the application
can indicate which portion of the message is to be encrypted, and then include a per-message security
token. By signing and/or encrypting the messages, the application obtains privacy, resists message
tampering, and detects dropped, suppressed, or replayed messages.

In Windows, the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) is the implementation of the GSS-
style authentication model. SSPI is a Windows-specific API implementation that provides the means
for connected network applications to call one of several security support providers (SSPs) to
establish authenticated connections and to exchange data securely over those connections. SSP is the
implementation of an authentication protocol as a dynamic link library (DLL). SSPI is the Windows
equivalent of GSS-API, and the two sets of APIs are on-the-wire compatible; hence, in this document,
the terms GSS-API and SSPI are used interchangeably.

For more information about the SSPI, see [SSPI].

1.2  Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

Active Directory: The Windows implementation of a general-purpose directory service, which uses

LDAP as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of
objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related
credential information used by Kerberos [MS-KILE]. Active Directory is either deployed as
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services
(AD LDS), which are both described in [MS-ADOD]: Active Directory Protocols Overview.

asymmetric encryption: An encryption method that uses one key to encrypt and uses a different

key to decrypt; these keys are linked by mathematical requirements.

asymmetric signature: A digital signature that is derived from a cryptographic operation by using
an asymmetric algorithm and a private key. An asymmetric signature is processed with two
different keys; one key is used to create the signature, and the other key is used to verify the
signature. These keys are linked by mathematical requirements.

Authentication Authority (AA): A system that acts as a trusted third-party system, such as a

Key Distribution Center (KDC).

Authentication Client: The total set of authentication protocol security support providers

(SSPs) that are typically available on a Windows client release.

authentication server: The entity that verifies that a person or thing is who or what it claims to

be (typically using a cryptographic protocol) and issues a ticket or token attesting to the validity
of the claim.

Authentication Service (AS): A service that issues ticket granting tickets (TGTs), which are used

for authenticating principals within the realm or domain served by the Authentication
Service.

authenticator: When used in reference to Kerberos, see Kerberos authenticator.

authorization: The secure computation of roles and accesses granted to an identity.

authorization data: An extensible field within a Kerberos ticket, used to pass authorization data

about the principal on whose behalf the ticket was issued to the application service.

challenge: A piece of data used to authenticate a user. Typically a challenge takes the form of a

nonce.

challenge/response authentication: A common authentication technique in which a principal is

prompted (the challenge) to provide some private information (the response) to facilitate
authentication.

claim: An assertion about a security principal expressed as the n-tuple {Identifier, ValueType, m

Value(s) of type ValueType} where m is greater than or equal to 1. A claim with only one Value
in the n-tuple is called a single-valued claim; a claim with more than one Value is called a multi-
valued claim.

client authentication: A mode of authentication in which only the client in the transaction proves

its identity.

client computer: The client machine in the domain or network topology of clients, servers, and
domain controllers. Alternatively, a computer that is not a domain controller server; the
computer might or might not be joined to a domain.

Common Internet File System (CIFS): The "NT LM 0.12" / NT LAN Manager dialect of the
Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol, as implemented in Windows NT. The CIFS name

originated in the 1990's as part of an attempt to create an Internet standard for SMB, based
upon the then-current Windows NT implementation.

Compound identity TGS-REQ: A FAST TGS-REQ that uses explicit FAST armoring using the

computer's ticket-granting ticket (TGT).

credential: Previously established, authentication data that is used by a security principal to

establish its own identity. When used in reference to the Netlogon Protocol, it is the data that is
stored in the NETLOGON_CREDENTIAL structure.

Data Encryption Standard (DES): A specification for encryption of computer data that uses a
56-bit key developed by IBM and adopted by the U.S. government as a standard in 1976. For
more information see [FIPS46-3].

delegation of authentication: The Kerberos mechanism whereby the client application

delegates its authentication to a front-end server by informing the Key Distribution Center
(KDC) that the front-end server is authorized to act on behalf of the identity of the user who is
running the client application to access protected resources that are located on a back-end
server.

Digest authentication: A protocol that uses a challenge-response mechanism for authentication

in which clients are able to verify their identities without sending an in-the-clear password to the
server. For more information, see [RFC2617] and [RFC2831].

Distributed File System (DFS): A file system that logically groups physical shared folders located
on different servers by transparently connecting them to one or more hierarchical namespaces.
DFS also provides fault-tolerance and load-sharing capabilities.

domain: A set of users and computers sharing a common namespace and management

infrastructure. At least one computer member of the set has to act as a domain controller
(DC) and host a member list that identifies all members of the domain, as well as optionally
hosting the Active Directory service. The domain controller provides authentication of
members, creating a unit of trust for its members. Each domain has an identifier that is shared
among its members. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5 and [MS-ADTS].

domain account: A stored set of attributes representing a principal used to authenticate a user or

machine to an Active Directory domain.

domain controller (DC): The service, running on a server, that implements Active Directory, or
the server hosting this service. The service hosts the data store for objects and interoperates
with other DCs to ensure that a local change to an object replicates correctly across all DCs.
When Active Directory is operating as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), the DC
contains full NC replicas of the configuration naming context (config NC), schema naming
context (schema NC), and one of the domain NCs in its forest. If the AD DS DC is a global
catalog server (GC server), it contains partial NC replicas of the remaining domain NCs in its
forest. For more information, see [MS-AUTHSOD] section 1.1.1.5.2 and [MS-ADTS]. When
Active Directory is operating as Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS),
several AD LDS DCs can run on one server. When Active Directory is operating as AD DS, only
one AD DS DC can run on one server. However, several AD LDS DCs can coexist with one AD
DS DC on one server. The AD LDS DC contains full NC replicas of the config NC and the schema
NC in its forest. The domain controller is the server side of Authentication Protocol Domain
Support [MS-APDS].

Domain Name System (DNS): A hierarchical, distributed database that contains mappings of
domain names to various types of data, such as IP addresses. DNS enables the location of
computers and services by user-friendly names, and it also enables the discovery of other
information stored in the database.

domain user: A user with an account in the domain's user account database.

user's TGT.

FAST TGS-REQ: A Kerberos TGS-REQ ([RFC4120] section 3.3) message that is armored with a

user's TGT.

Flexible Authentication Secure Tunneling (FAST): FAST provides a protected channel between

the client and the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

forest: One or more domains that share a common schema and trust each other transitively. An
organization can have multiple forests. A forest establishes the security and administrative
boundary for all the objects that reside within the domains that belong to the forest. In
contrast, a domain establishes the administrative boundary for managing objects, such as
users, groups, and computers. In addition, each domain has individual security policies and
trust relationships with other domains.

Generic Security Services (GSS): An Internet standard, as described in [RFC2743], for providing
security services to applications. It consists of an application programming interface (GSS-API)
set, as well as standards that describe the structure of the security data.

global catalog server (GC server): A domain controller (DC) that contains a naming context

(NC) replica (one full, the rest partial) for each domain naming context in the forest.

Group Policy: A mechanism that allows the implementer to specify managed configurations for

users and computers in an Active Directory service environment.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): An extension of HTTP that securely encrypts and

decrypts web page requests. In some older protocols, "Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure
Sockets Layer" is still used (Secure Sockets Layer has been deprecated). For more information,
see [SSL3] and [RFC5246].

identity store: The set of users on a single computer or the identities that are available in a

domain.

interactive logon: A software method in which the account information and credentials input by

the user interactively are authenticated by a server or domain controller (DC).

Kerberos: An authentication system that enables two parties to exchange private information

across an otherwise open network by assigning a unique key (called a ticket) to each user that
logs on to the network and then embedding these tickets into messages sent by the users. For
more information, see [MS-KILE].

Kerberos authenticator: A record sent with a ticket to a server to certify the client's knowledge
of the session key in the ticket; to help the server detect replay attacks by proving that the
authenticator is recently constructed; and to help the two parties select additional session keys
for a particular connection authenticated by Kerberos. The use of authenticators, including how
authenticators are validated, is specified in [RFC4120] section 5.5.1. For more information, see
[KAUFMAN].

Key Distribution Center (KDC): The Kerberos service that implements the authentication and
ticket granting services specified in the Kerberos protocol. The service runs on computers
selected by the administrator of the realm or domain; it is not present on every machine on the
network. It has to have access to an account database for the realm that it serves. KDCs are
integrated into the domain controller role. It is a network service that supplies tickets to
clients for use in authenticating to services.

keyed hash: A cryptographic hash computed over both a symmetric key and data, as specified in

[RFC2617]. For more information, see [RFC2104].

LDAP directory: The database that stores information about LDAP objects ([RFC2251]), such as

users, groups, computers, and printers.

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The primary access protocol for Active

Directory. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard protocol,
established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which allows users to query and
update information in a directory service (DS), as described in [MS-ADTS]. The Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol can be either version 2 [RFC1777] or version 3 [RFC3377].

Local Security Authority (LSA): A protected subsystem that authenticates and logs users onto

the local system. LSA also maintains information about all aspects of local security on a system,
collectively known as the local security policy of the system.

mutual authentication: A mode in which each party verifies the identity of the other party, as

described in [RFC3748] section 7.2.1.

Netlogon: The Netlogon Remote Protocol, as specified in [MS-NRPC].

network logon: A software method in which the account information and credentials previously

supplied by the user as part of an interactive logon are used again to log the user onto another
network resource.

nonce: A number that is used only once. This is typically implemented as a random number large

enough that the probability of number reuse is extremely small. A nonce is used in
authentication protocols to prevent replay attacks. For more information, see [RFC2617].

NT LAN Manager (NTLM): An authentication protocol that is based on a challenge-response

sequence for authentication.

NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Authentication Protocol: A protocol using a challenge-response

mechanism for authentication in which clients are able to verify their identities without sending a
password to the server. It consists of three messages, commonly referred to as Type 1
(negotiation), Type 2 (challenge) and Type 3 (authentication).

NTP: Network Time Protocol (NTP), as specified in [MS-SNTP].

NTP server: The server role of the Network Time Protocol (NTP).

object identifier (OID): In the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), a sequence of

numbers in a format described by [RFC1778]. In many LDAP directory implementations, an OID
is the standard internal representation of an attribute. In the directory model used in this
specification, the more familiar ldapDisplayName represents an attribute.

pre-authentication: In Kerberos, a state in which a key distribution center (KDC) demands
that the requestor in the Authentication Service (AS) exchange demonstrate knowledge of the
key associated with the account. If the requestor cannot demonstrate this knowledge, the KDC
will not issue a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) ([RFC4120] sections 5.2.7 and 7.5.2).

private key: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The private key is kept secret
and is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the corresponding public key. For an
introduction to this concept, see [CRYPTO] section 1.8 and [IEEE1363] section 3.1.

privilege attribute certificate (PAC): A Microsoft-specific authorization data present in the
authorization data field of a ticket. The PAC contains several logical components, including
group membership data for authorization, alternate credentials for non-Kerberos authentication
protocols, and policy control information for supporting interactive logon.

proxy: An intermediary program that acts as both a server and a client for the purpose of making

requests on behalf of other clients (see [RFC2616] section 1.3).

public key: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The public key is distributed
freely and published as part of a digital certificate. For an introduction to this concept, see
[CRYPTO] section 1.8 and [IEEE1363] section 3.1.

public key infrastructure (PKI): The laws, policies, standards, and software that regulate or

manipulate certificates and public and private keys. In practice, it is a system of digital
certificates, certificate authorities (CAs), and other registration authorities that verify and
authenticate the validity of each party involved in an electronic transaction. For more
information, see [X509] section 6.

realm: A collection of key distribution centers (KDCs) with a common set of principals, as

described in [RFC4120] section 1.2.

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): A multi-channel protocol that allows a user to connect to a
computer running Microsoft Terminal Services (TS). RDP enables the exchange of client and
server settings and also enables negotiation of common settings to use for the duration of the
connection, so that input, graphics, and other data can be exchanged and processed between
client and server.

secret key: A symmetric encryption key shared by two entities, such as between a user and the
domain controller (DC), with a long lifetime. A password is a common example of a secret
key. When used in a context that implies Kerberos only, a principal's secret key.

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): A security protocol that supports confidentiality and integrity of

messages in client and server applications that communicate over open networks. SSL supports
server and, optionally, client authentication using X.509 certificates [X509] and [RFC5280]. SSL
is superseded by Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS version 1.0 is based on SSL version
3.0 [SSL3].

Security Account Manager (SAM): A centrally managed service, such as Active Directory

Domain Services (AD DS), that enables a server to establish a trust relationship with other
authorized servers. The SAM also maintains information about domains and security
principals, and provides client-to-server information by using several available standards for
access control lists (ACLs).

security account manager (SAM) built-in database: The part of the user account database
that contains account information (such as account names and passwords) for accounts and
groups that are pre-created at the database installation.

security context: An abstract data structure that contains authorization information for a

particular security principal in the form of a Token/Authorization Context (see [MS-DTYP]
section 2.5.2). A server uses the authorization information in a security context to check
access to requested resources. A security context also contains a key identifier that associates
mutually established cryptographic keys, along with other information needed to perform secure
communication with another security principal.

security identifier (SID): An identifier for security principals that is used to identify an account

or a group. Conceptually, the SID is composed of an account authority portion (typically a
domain) and a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority,
termed the relative identifier (RID). The SID format is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2; a
string representation of SIDs is specified in [MS-DTYP] section 2.4.2 and [MS-AZOD] section
1.1.1.2.

security principal: An identity that can be used to regulate access to resources. A security

principal can be a user, a computer, or a group that represents a set of users.

security support provider (SSP): A dynamic-link library (DLL) that implements the Security
Support Provider Interface (SSPI) by making one or more security packages available to
applications. Each security package provides mappings between an application's SSPI function
calls and an actual security model's functions. Security packages support security protocols such
as Kerberos authentication and NTLM.

Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI): An API that allows connected applications to call
one of several security providers to establish authenticated connections and to exchange data
securely over those connections. It is equivalent to Generic Security Services (GSS)-API, and
the two are on-the-wire compatible.

security token: An opaque message or data packet produced by a Generic Security Services

(GSS)-style authentication package and carried by the application protocol. The application has
no visibility into the contents of the token.

server authentication: A mode of authentication in which only the server in the transaction

proves its identity.

server computer: The server role in the network topology of client/server/domain controller.

Server Message Block (SMB): A protocol that is used to request file and print services from
server systems over a network. The SMB protocol extends the CIFS protocol with additional
security, file, and disk management support. For more information, see [CIFS] and [MS-SMB].

service principal name (SPN): The name a client uses to identify a service for mutual

authentication. (For more information, see [RFC1964] section 2.1.1.) An SPN consists of either
two parts or three parts, each separated by a forward slash ('/'). The first part is the service
class, the second part is the host name, and the third part (if present) is the service name. For
example, "ldap/dc-01.fabrikam.com/fabrikam.com" is a three-part SPN where "ldap" is the
service class name, "dc-01.fabrikam.com" is the host name, and "fabrikam.com" is the service
name. See [SPNNAMES] for more information about SPN format and composing a unique SPN.

service ticket: A ticket for any service other than the ticket-granting service (TGS). A service
ticket serves only to classify a ticket as not a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) or cross-realm
TGT, as specified in [RFC4120].

session key: A relatively short-lived symmetric key (a cryptographic key negotiated by the client
and the server based on a shared secret). A session key's lifespan is bounded by the session
to which it is associated. A session key has to be strong enough to withstand cryptanalysis for
the lifespan of the session.

Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO): An authentication

mechanism that allows Generic Security Services (GSS) peers to determine whether their
credentials support a common set of GSS-API security mechanisms, to negotiate different
options within a given security mechanism or different options from several security
mechanisms, to select a service, and to establish a security context among themselves using
that service. SPNEGO is specified in [RFC4178].

smart card: A portable device that is shaped like a business card and is embedded with a memory
chip and either a microprocessor or some non-programmable logic. Smart cards are often used
as authentication tokens and for secure key storage. Smart cards used for secure key storage
have the ability to perform cryptographic operations with the stored key without allowing the
key itself to be read or otherwise extracted from the card.

SMB dialect: There are several different versions and subversions of the Server Message Block
(SMB) protocol. A particular version of the SMB protocol is referred to as an SMB dialect.
Different SMB dialects can include both new SMB messages as well as changes to the fields
and semantics of existing SMB messages used in other SMB dialects. When an SMB client
connects to an SMB server, the client and server negotiate the SMB dialect to be used.

symmetric encryption: An encryption method that uses the same cryptographic key to encrypt

and decrypt a given message.

ticket: A record generated by the key distribution center (KDC) that helps a client authenticate
to a service. It contains the client's identity, a unique cryptographic key for use with this ticket
(the session key), a time stamp, and other information, all sealed using the service's secret
key. It only serves to authenticate a client when presented along with a valid authenticator.

ticket-granting service (TGS): A service that issues tickets for admission to other services in its

own domain or for admission to the ticket-granting service in another domain.

ticket-granting ticket (TGT): A special type of ticket that can be used to obtain other tickets.

The TGT is obtained after the initial authentication in the Authentication Service (AS) exchange;
thereafter, users do not need to present their credentials, but can use the TGT to obtain
subsequent tickets.

Transport Layer Security (TLS): A security protocol that supports confidentiality and integrity of
messages in client and server applications communicating over open networks. TLS supports
server and, optionally, client authentication by using X.509 certificates (as specified in [X509]).
TLS is standardized in the IETF TLS working group.

user principal name (UPN): A user account name (sometimes referred to as the user logon

name) and a domain name that identifies the domain in which the user account is located. This
is the standard usage for logging on to a Windows domain. The format is:
someone@example.com (in the form of an email address). In Active Directory, the
userPrincipalName attribute of the account object, as described in [MS-ADTS].

X.509: An ITU-T standard for public key infrastructure subsequently adapted by the IETF, as

specified in [RFC3280].

2  Functional Architecture

The Authentication Services protocols provide authentication services through the following methods:



Interactive logon authentication

  Network logon authentication (also called noninteractive authentication)

The following sections provide an overview of interactive logon authentication and network logon
authentication, the protocols involved, and the relationships of these protocols with the relevant
standard protocols.

2.1  Overview

The following diagram illustrates the high-level interactions between the internal components of
Authentication Services and other external systems, including the public key infrastructure (PKI),
Authorization, and the account database.

Applications

22 / 94

Applications can be interactive applications, such as Winlogon, or distributed client and server
applications, such as a web browser, web server, or a file client or a file server, or any other type of
client and server application.

Account database

An account database maintains the security principals and necessary information for authentication
and other purposes. In Windows, an Active Directory database maintains the domain security
principals, whereas the security account manager (SAM) built-in database maintains local
security principals. In Windows NT 4.0 operating system, both domain controllers (DCs) and
workstations store security principal accounts in a SAM database, which uses the Windows registry for
underlying persistent storage. Starting with Windows 2000 operating system, the domain security
principals are stored in Active Directory instead of the registry.

The account database is the portion of the directory that maintains the accounts for the principals of
the domain. In Windows NT 4.0 domains, the account database includes all the information in the
Windows NT 4.0 domain. In Active Directory domains, the account database contains a subset of the
entire LDAP-accessible directory that an Active Directory domain hosts.

As a final step to the authentication process, the account database verifies identities.

Public key infrastructure (PKI)

Windows PKI provides a framework of services, technology, protocols, and standards that enable the
deployment and management of a strong information security system that is based on public key
technology. Authentication Services interact with Windows PKI to encrypt and decrypt messages, to
sign and verify messages, and to verify the identities of the client and server by using digital
certificates. As shown in the preceding diagram, distributed client and server applications interact with
Windows PKI for certificate enrollment, renewal, and certificate signature validation.

The SSL/TLS [MS-TLSP], PKINIT [MS-PKCA], and Kerberos Network Authentication Service [MS-SFU]
protocols assume that Windows PKI functions are available as described in [MS-CERSOD].

Windows PKI relies on Microsoft CryptoAPI version 2 for secure cryptographic operations and private
key management.

Authorization

After an identity is authenticated, the next step is to use the identity to authorize access to a
resource. Authorization provides an interface for applications to make authorization decisions.

2.1.1  Interactive Logon Authentication

The interactive logons authentication section with its subsections describe the process and the
methods by which authentication protocols work in conjunction to prove the user's identity. Interactive
logon authentication is used to grant user access to both local and domain resources. Using a
computer that is running Windows in a network environment requires access to system services. Each
client that requests access to a system service is authenticated by that service. Authentication
requires the service to have proof of the user's credentials. The interactive logon task begins when a
user enters credentials to log on by using the Windows user interface. The credentials consist of a user
name and password for logon with a local account, and the user's user name, password, and domain
for logon with a domain account. A smart card containing a user's public key information can also
be used after the user obtains and unlocks it with a personal identification number (PIN).

Users can perform an interactive logon by using a local user account for local logon or a domain
account for domain logon. The interactive logon process confirms the user's identification by using the
security account database on the user's local computer or by using the domain's directory service.
This mandatory logon process cannot be turned off for users in a domain.

A user can interactively logon to a computer in one of two ways:



Locally, when the user has direct physical access to the computer.

  Remotely, through Terminal Services, in which case the logon is further qualified as remote

interactive. Microsoft Terminal Server uses the CredSSP Protocol [MS-CSSP] to securely delegate
the user's password or smart card PIN from the client to the server to remotely log on the user
and to establish a Terminal Services session.

After an interactive logon, Windows runs applications on the user's behalf, and the user interacts with
those applications to access protected resources either locally or on remote computers.

Local logon

Logon to a local account grants a user access to Windows resources on the local computer and
requires that the user has a user account in the account database maintained by the Security
Account Manager (SAM) on the local computer. The SAM protects and manages user and group
information in the form of security accounts that are stored in the local computer registry. The
computer can have network access, but it is not required. Local user account and group membership
information is used to manage access to local resources.

Domain logon

A domain logon is a process that proves the identity of the user to the domain controller, implies
eventual user access to local and domain resources, and requires that the user has a user account in
an account database, such as Active Directory. The computer needs to have an account in the Active
Directory domain and be physically connected to the network. Users need the privileges required to
log on to a local computer or a domain. Domain user account information and group membership
information is used to manage access to domain and local resources.

Smart card domain logon

Logging on to a domain with a smart card provides a strong form of authentication, because smart
cards use keys that are stronger than a human can easily remember, and because two factors are
required: the PIN and the card.

For interactive domain logon, the validation process relies on authenticating domain user credentials
against the domain's directory service.

2.1.1.1  Abstract Components

The following block diagram illustrates abstract components that are involved in the interactive
domain logon authentication process. The abstract components on the domain-joined client
computer are the Local Security Authority (LSA), the client implementation of the authentication
protocols, and the components on the Authentication Authority (AA): for example, a domain
controller consists of a server implementation of authentication protocols, a PKI, and an account
database. The Windows user logon interface calls the LSA method to securely transfer the user
credentials to the Authentication Authority through a specified authentication protocol. The
Authentication Authority verifies the user credentials against the account database.

2.1.1.2  Protocol Interactions

The following diagram illustrates the internal system architecture of the interactive domain logon
authentication task. The authentication protocols that are involved in the interactive domain logon
authentication process are:

Domain Logon (Username and Password):

  Kerberos Protocol Extensions [MS-KILE] [RFC4120]

  Authentication Protocol Domain Support [MS-APDS] - NTLM pass-through

Smart card Domain Logon (X.509 Certificate):



Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication [MS-PKCA] [RFC4556]

Figure 4: Protocol interactions for interactive domain logon authentication

If the user credentials consist of a user name and password pair, the domain logon authentication
process first tries the Kerberos Authentication Protocol ([MS-KILE]). If Kerberos fails, the
authentication process falls back to the NTLM pass-through mechanism ([MS-APDS]). For smart card
logons in which the credentials contain X.509 certificates, the domain logon process uses the Public
Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (PKINIT) in the Kerberos Protocol ([MS-PKCA]).

A Kerberos client attempts to prove the user identity by sending Kerberos protocol messages to
request a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) and a service ticket from the Key Distribution Center
(KDC). The KDC verifies the user identity against the account database and returns the TGT to the
Kerberos client. In subsequent messages, the Kerberos client requests the service ticket for a domain-
joined computer from the KDC. The KDC attempts to validate the TGT. If the validation succeeds, the
KDC returns the service ticket to the Kerberos client.

Next, the Kerberos client submits the service ticket to verify the user logon information. If the
Kerberos authentication fails, the APDS client on the domain-joined computer calls the NTLM pass-
through mechanism to prove the user identity and to get the user logon information. The APDS server
validates the user credentials against the account database; if the validation succeeds, the APDS
server returns the user logon information.

In the smart card logon scenario, the Kerberos client requests the TGT and service ticket from the
KDC by proving the user's identity in the form of an X.509 certificate, as described in [MS-PKCA]. The
KDC verifies the user identity against the account database by using PKI services and returns a TGT
and a service ticket. The Kerberos client submits the service ticket to the Kerberos server to validate
the service ticket and the user logon information. If the validation of user logon information succeeds,
interactive domain logon is permitted; otherwise, logon attempts fail.

2.1.2  Network Logon Authentication

The network logon authentication section with its subsections describe the process and the methods
by which authentication protocols work in conjunction to prove the user's identity. Network logon
authentication is used only after interactive logon authentication has taken place. Network logon
does not rely on user interface components, such as a dialog box, to collect data. Instead, previously
established credentials or another method to collect credentials is used. This process confirms the
user's identity to any network service that the user attempts to access. This process is typically
invisible to the user, unless the user is required to provide alternate credentials.

2.1.2.1  Abstract Components

The following block diagram illustrates abstract components that are involved in the network logon
process. Network logon authentication is performed when an application uses underlying
authentication protocol packages through the GSS-API layer to establish a secure network connection.
Network logon authentication is the mechanism at work when a user connects to multiple machines on
a network. For example, if an application needs to open a secure folder on a remote machine and the
application user is already logged on to a domain user account, the application does not require the
user to supply logon data again. Instead, the application requests network logon authentication by
using the GSS-API layer to pass the previously established security information to underlying security
support providers (SSPs).

Figure 5: Network logon authentication architecture

The preceding diagram shows the network logon authentication architecture that distributed client and
server applications in a domain environment use. The communication between the client and server
applications can occur over application communication protocols that are LAN-oriented ([MS-SMB],
[MS-SMB2], [MS-CIFS], and [MS-RPCE]) or Internet-oriented (HTTP, [MS-POP3], [MS-NNTP], and
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)).

The GSS-API is an application programming interface standard [RFC2743] that insulates application
communication protocols and authentication protocols.

GSS-API main functionality

[MS-AUTHSOD] - v20211026
Authentication Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2021 Microsoft Corporation
Release: October 26, 2021

27 / 94

The primary purpose of GSS-API is to abstract the commonalities of different authentication protocols
and to hide their implementation details.

A related purpose is to disentangle application communication protocols from authentication protocols.
An authentication protocol should be available to any application communication protocol. Its
implementation should not contain any application protocol-specific information.

To facilitate application protocol interactions with authentication protocols, GSS-API uses the
abstractions of credentials and security contexts. Credentials authenticate a security principal,
such as a user name, password, or certificate. In a GSS-API client and server scenario, each party
provides some type of credential. GSS-API uses these credentials to perform the authentication. A
security context is a collection of authenticated information about a security principal for an instance
of a session.

Throughout the GSS-API authentication process, the client and server exchange partial context
information in the form of security tokens. In this process, the GSS-API client and server each
initially obtains credentials and then calls the GSS-API to create security tokens to send to its
counterpart. Likewise, when a GSS-API client or server receives a security token from the other, it
uses the GSS-API to process and incorporate the security token, which contains authentication
protocol-specific data, into the security context for the authenticated relationship.

In GSS-API authentication, the client and server send and receive security tokens until authentication
succeeds or fails. After successful GSS-API authentication, the client and server each has a security
context that establishes an authenticated relationship with the other. These security contexts do not
contain the credentials that are used to create them, however, they can contain information from the
authentication process that is useful to the application for securing communications, such as an
encryption key. They can also contain information for maintaining the authenticated connection, such
as a Kerberos ticket or certificate or other information that is useful in authorizing the client's
request, such as security claims about the client. The security support provider (SSP) that performs
the authentication determines the contents of the context.

The following diagram illustrates GSS-API authentication between client and server application
protocols.

Custom Authentication Protocols:

Authentication Services provides an extensible network logon authentication architecture, which allows
implementers to add custom authentication protocol security support providers (SSPs) to the
system architecture.

Authentication protocol selection

Both the client and server application protocols can select any authentication protocol from the list of
supported authentication protocols through the GSS-API interface, either directly or indirectly.

The client and server application protocols can directly select any of the following authentication
protocols through the GSS-API interface: Digest [MS-DPSP], NTLM [MS-NLMP], CSSP [MS-CSSP],
Kerberos [MS-KILE], and SPNEGO [MS-SPNG].

Application protocols can select indirectly any of the following authentication protocols: NTLM [MS-
NLMP], Kerberos [MS-KILE], NEGOEX [MS-NEGOEX], PKU2U, and CUSTOM.

The difference between direct and indirect selection is the use of the SPNEGO protocol. Application
protocols use the SPNEGO protocol when they attempt to select an authentication protocol indirectly;
alternatively, application protocols can select the authentication protocol directly without using
SPNEGO. Because support for these authentication protocols varies across Windows releases and
application environments, the client and server application protocols have to select a mutually
supported authentication protocol either directly or indirectly. For example, for a client and server to
use the Kerberos authentication protocol, each have to support it.

An authentication protocol is selected in one of three ways:

  Assertion

  Application-Level Negotiation

  Negotiate

Application-Level Negotiation uses the application-specific method or configuration to select the
mutually agreed-on authentication protocol between client and server application protocols, whereas
the other two options use Authentication Services.

31 / 94

[MS-AUTHSOD] - v20211026
Authentication Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2021 Microsoft Corporation
Release: October 26, 2021

Assertion

As a precondition for using Assertion to specify a mutually agreed-on authentication protocol when
calling GSS-API, both the client and the server directly specify a single authentication protocol from
the supported authentication protocols.

When the application or server uses only one authentication protocol for the exchange, it specifies
(asserts) the protocol to use when replying to a client request to access a service. If the client does
not support that protocol, the communication fails. This method of selection is called Assertion.

Application-Level Negotiation

When a client and a server support multiple authentication protocols, before authentication can take
place, applications exchange application-specific messages to select a commonly supported
authentication protocol. For example, if a client supports Kerberos and Digest and the server supports
NTLM and Digest, the common protocol that they both support is Digest, so the client and the server
can negotiate to use the Digest protocol. Similarly, the HTTP protocol uses the WWW-Authenticate
and Authorization headers in its negotiation.

Negotiate

The Negotiate option allows the client and server applications that are engaged in the authentication
process to select a mutually agreed-upon authentication protocol from a set of possible authentication
protocols by using the SPNEGO protocol [MS-SPNG].

When the authentication process begins with the option to negotiate for an authentication protocol,
the server or client can initiate the negotiation.

The server-initiated SPNEGO exchange takes place as follows:

1.  The client requests access to a service in an application-protocol-specific way.

2.  The server replies with a list of authentication protocols that it supports with its preferred

authentication protocol as its first choice in the application protocol message. For example, the
server might list Kerberos [MS-KILE], NEGOEX [MS-NEGOEX], and NTLM [MS-NLMP], and select
Kerberos as its preferred protocol.

3.  The client examines the contents of the reply and checks to determine whether it supports any of

the specified protocols.





If the client supports the preferred authentication protocol, authentication proceeds.

If the client does not support the preferred authentication protocol but does support one of the
other protocols that the server lists, the client informs the server as to which authentication
protocol it supports, and the authentication process continues.



If the client does not support any of the listed protocols, the authentication exchange fails.

The client-initiated SPNEGO takes place as follows:

1.  The client sends a list of authentication protocols and also a preferred authentication protocol to

the server.

2.  The server examines the contents of the request message and checks to determine whether it

supports any of the specified authentication protocols.





If the server supports the preferred authentication protocol, authentication proceeds.

If the server does not support the preferred authentication protocol but does support one of
the other protocols that the client lists, the server informs the client as to which authentication
protocol it supports, and the authentication process continues.

Release: October 26, 2021



If the server does not support any of the listed protocols, the authentication exchange fails.

As shown in the preceding diagram, through the negotiation option, the client and server applications
can select NTLM, Kerberos, PKU2U, or a custom authentication protocol as the mutually agreed-on
authentication protocol. To select either the PKU2U or the custom authentication protocol, the
application uses the NEGOEX protocol, which extends the SPNEGO protocol and enables the
application protocol to choose a mutually agreed-on authentication protocol that is based on policy
information.

For example, if the server specifies Kerberos and NTLM and returns Kerberos as its preferred
authentication protocol, one client can immediately authenticate by using Kerberos, but another client
could negotiate to complete the authentication exchange by using NTLM.

Auxiliary protocols

If the client and server agree on any of the following authentication protocols: Digest [MS-DPSP],
NTLM [MS-NLMP], or SSL/TLS [MS-TLSP], an auxiliary protocol carries the credentials information
from the server to the Authentication Authority (AA), for example, a Windows DC. This mechanism
is called a pass-through mechanism.

When the client and server agree on either the Digest or the NTLM protocol, the Authentication
Protocol Domain Support [MS-APDS] performs the pass-through. Otherwise, if the client and server
agree on SSL/TLS, Remote Certificate Mapping Protocol [MS-RCMP] is used for pass-through.

2.1.2.3  Enterprise Environment

The protocols commonly used in enterprise environments for authentication and secure transport of
application data are listed in section 2.2.1. The following section describes how distributed applications
use the Authentication Services protocols in the enterprise environment, with the file access services
as an example.

2.1.2.3.1 File Access Services

The File Access Services section describes the steps that the file access services protocols ([MS-
FASOD]) undertake to support authentication.

The core protocols of the file access services are:

  Common Internet File System (CIFS) Protocol [MS-CIFS]

  Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol [MS-SMB]

  Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol Versions 2 and 3 [MS-SMB2]

To enforce access controls over files and resources on a file server the server acquires the validated
identity of the requestor, as illustrated in the following diagram. The file access services protocols
depend on Authentication Services to support several authentication protocols and depend on the
ability to negotiate the authentication protocol between the client and server.

In addition to the authentication support that CIFS provides, SMB provides new authentication
methods that include Kerberos. The SMB Negotiate and SMB Session Setup commands have been
enhanced to carry opaque security tokens to support mechanisms that are compatible with the
Generic Security Services (GSS) [RFC2743].

Figure 8: Authentication protocol standards in the enterprise environment

The preceding diagram shows that network traffic conforms to the file access services protocols that
are used between the file system client and the file system server. The file access services protocols
that are used between file access client and server carry authentication protocol messages as opaque
payloads in their protocol messages.

SMB and SMB2 rely on the Simple and Protected Generic Security Service Application Programming
Interface Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) ([RFC4178], [MS-SPNG], and [MS-NEGOEX]) for
authentication, which in turn relies on Kerberos [MS-KILE] and on the NTLM [MS-NLMP]
challenge/response authentication protocol. If the agreed-on authentication protocol between
client and server is NTLM [MS-NLMP], the file server authenticates the user credentials provided by
the file access services client using the APDS protocol [MS-APDS] to the DC that contains the user
account information. Otherwise, if the authentication protocol is Kerberos [MS-KILE], the file server
authenticates the user identity by validating the service ticket to the SMB service submitted by the
file system client.

2.1.2.3.2 Remote Desktop and Web Services

In Windows, the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [MS-RDPBCGR] and the Web Services
Management Protocol [MS-WSMV] use the CredSSP Protocol to delegate the user's credentials from
the client to the target server.

Figure 9: Credential delegation through the CredSSP Protocol

The preceding diagram shows that RDP and the Web Services Management Protocol trigger the
CredSSP Protocol to delegate the user's credentials. For more details about how and when these
protocols trigger the CredSSP Protocol, refer to [MS-RDPBCGR] or [MS-WSMV].

As described in [MS-CSSP], the CredSSP Protocol first establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS)-
encrypted channel between the client and the target server by using the SSL/TLS Protocol [MS-TLSP].
The CredSSP Protocol uses TLS as an encrypted pipe; it does not rely on the client or server
authentication services that are available in TLS. The CredSSP Protocol then uses the SPNEGO
Protocol [MS-SPNG] and [MS-NEGOEX] to negotiate the NTLM or Kerberos authentication protocol
that performs mutual authentication and provides confidentiality services, which are used to
securely bind to the TLS channel and encrypt the credentials for the target server. In environments
where the Kerberos protocol is not supported, the NTLM protocol is selected to establish trust between
the client computer and the server computer. Otherwise, the Kerberos authentication protocol is
selected because the Kerberos protocol ensures server authentication.

The Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) Proxy Protocol [MS-KKDCP] is used to allow Kerberos
clients to use KDC proxy servers to communicate to KDCs for Kerberos Network Authentication Service
(V5) protocol [RFC4120] and Kerberos change password protocol exchanges [RFC3244]. RDP and
IPsec are examples of KDC proxy usage.

When a Kerberos client does not have connectivity to the KDC, but the client could use Kerberos to
authenticate to an application server, Kerberos normally fails. With a Kerberos proxy client on the
client host and a KDC proxy server with connectivity to the KDC, Kerberos authentication can be used
to authenticate to the application server. The Kerberos proxy client sends standard Kerberos
Authentication Service, ticket-granting service (TGS), and change password requests in HTTPS

messages to the KDC proxy server. The KDC proxy server locates the KDC, sends these messages to
the located KDC, and returns the received replies via HTTPS to the client.

2.1.2.4  Intranet Web Environment

The protocols that are commonly used in intranet web environments for authentication and secure
transportation of application data are listed in section 2.2.2. The following section describes how
distributed applications use the Authentication Services protocols in the intranet web environment.

2.1.2.4.1 HTTP Access Authentication

HTTP Access Authentication is described in this section as an HTTP 1.1 [RFC2616] authentication,
whereas Basic and Digest Access Authentication is addressed in [RFC2617]. HTTP is used
internationally for Internet web servicing. The general topology of the HTTP protocol is that of a
client/server role. The HTTP client makes requests that are sent to the HTTP server. The HTTP server
can enforce authentication requirements on the HTTP requests. If a request lacks valid authentication
material in the HTTP header, the HTTP server generates a Challenge message (token), which is sent to
the HTTP client. The HTTP client can then form a ChallengeResponse token based on user credentials
that are applied to the authentication protocol. The initial Request along with the ChallengeResponse
token is sent again to the HTTP server. The HTTP server can then validate the ChallengeResponse

token in processing the request. This task focuses on the HTTP server side of the authentication
exchange.

HTTP authentication [RFC2617] contains specification details on two forms of authentication: Basic
and Digest authentication. The HTTP authentication framework is extensible to other authentication
mechanisms. This capability provides opportunities to extend the types of authentication that are
available for use in HTTP requests.

Authentication is also possible by way of forms-based authentication. Here the user credentials (user
name and password) are entered by the user in an HTTP format and are transmitted in clear text to
the HTTP server, typically by using a secure HTTPS connection. The HTTP server can then validate the
user credentials. This type of authentication is not part of the HTTP authentication protocol [RFC2617]
and is not covered in additional detail.

Following are the steps that the web server undertakes for HTTP Web Access Authentication. Enforcing
access controls over files and resources on an HTTP server requires the server to recognize the
validated identity of the requestor, the files, and the resources to be configured for access control to
enforce authentication and authorization. The following diagram illustrates the network traffic that
conforms to the web-based protocols that are used between the web browser and the web server.

Figure 11: Authentication protocol standards in an intranet web environment

When a browser uses NTLM [MS-NLMP] or Digest Protocol Extensions [MS-DPSP], if the user's account
information is not available locally, the web server authenticates the user credentials provided by the
web browser by using the APDS protocol to the DC that contains the user's account information.

[MS-AUTHSOD] - v20211026
Authentication Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2021 Microsoft Corporation
Release: October 26, 2021

When a web browser uses the SSL/TLS [MS-TLSP] protocols to provide an X.509 certificate, if the
user's account information is not available locally, the web server uses the Remote Certificate Mapping
Protocol [MS-RCMP] to authenticate the certificate with the DC that contains the user's account.

When a web browser uses Kerberos [MS-KILE] for web authentication, a service ticket to the web
service is obtained from the DC.

2.1.2.5  Mixed Web Environment

As listed in section 2.2.3, the authentication protocols that are primarily used in web environments for
authentication and secure transportation of application data are Digest Protocol Extensions [MS-
DPSP], Transport Layer Security (TLS) Profile [MS-TLSP], and HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest
Access Authentication [RFC2617].

The following diagram illustrates authentication protocol interactions in a mixed web environment,
which is the combination of Internet and enterprise environments.

If users have domain accounts but have to connect to a web server from outside the domain or
from an untrusted domain (for example, over the Internet), clients cannot use the SPNEGO [MS-
SPNG] and [MS-NEGOEX] or Kerberos [MS-KILE] protocols. Instead, clients can use custom
authentication protocols, an HTTP authentication mechanism, or the SSL/TLS protocol [MS-TLSP] and
then can transition to Kerberos protocol extensions.

a domain is influenced by this system. However, the following groups of related protocols depend
more closely on the Authentication Services protocols:

Active Directory [MS-ADOD]: Describes how the directory is structured and how LDAP operations
are carried out on the directory store. To authenticate the identities of clients that attempt to
operate on the directory store, Active Directory uses the Authentication Services protocols to
authenticate so that authorization decisions can be made, such as whether a client has
permission to perform a particular operation against a directory object.

Certificate Services [MS-CERSOD]: Describes how the certificate authority leverages the

Authentication Services protocols to manage certificate distribution and enrollment and makes
authorization decisions that are based on information that is associated with the accounts in the
domain.

File Access Services [MS-FASOD]: Describes its dependance on the Authentication Services

protocols to authenticate an identity before it is determined whether the requested identity has
the required access rights on a file object, such as permission to read from a file or write to a file.

Group Policy Protocols [MS-GPOD]: Describes how a domain client can retrieve group policy

information from a domain controller, which is based on the group memberships of the domain
accounts and on the domain account locations in the LDAP directory structure. Group Policy
protocols depend on the Authentication Services protocols to secure communications between
the Group Policy client and the Group Policy server.

Remote Desktop Services Protocols [MS-RDSOD]: Describes the functionality to securely connect
remote clients and servers, to channel communication between components of remote clients and
servers, and to manage servers. RDP protocols depend on the services of the Authentication
Services protocols to authenticate identities and to help ensure secure communications.

2.3.2  Dependencies on Other Systems/Components

The Authentication Services protocols depend on the following systems:

  Active Directory [MS-ADOD]



Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) [MS-CERSOD]

The Authentication Services protocols depend on Active Directory for identity information.

The Authentication Services protocols depend on the certificate authority (CA)/PKI infrastructure for
certificate validation, signature validation, and asymmetric cryptography security services. Microsoft
clients use the Crypto API 2.0 library for these features.

2.4  Assumptions and Preconditions

The following assumptions and preconditions apply to this document.

2.5.1  Summary of Supporting Actors and System Interests

The use cases of the Authentication Services protocols have the following supporting actors:

  Account database: To authenticate client and server application identities, the Authentication

Services protocols depend on the account database (account DB) as an identity store. Windows
uses an account database implemented by means of Active Directory Services, as described in
[MS-ADOD]. The account DB is on the same machine as the Authentication Authority (AA), so
no network traffic occurs.

[MS-AUTHSOD] - v20211026
Authentication Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2021 Microsoft Corporation
Release: October 26, 2021

  Public key infrastructure (PKI): To authenticate the identities of client and server applications

that use certificate-based authentication mechanisms, the Authentication Services protocols use
Windows PKI to verify digital certificates and use the symmetric and asymmetric cryptography
services of Windows PKI to provide security services, such as encryption and signing algorithms to
the client and server applications. Windows implements PKI by means of Certificate Services [MS-
CERSOD].

2.5.2  Actors

The actors that participate in the Authentication Services protocols use cases are:

  Client applications: Used to access and manipulate protected network resources. Client

applications use the authentication and security services of the Authentication Services protocols
to communicate with and to send requests to the server applications.

  Server applications: Provide services to the client applications. Server applications use the

authentication and security services of the Authentication Services protocols to communicate with
and to send responses to the client applications.

  LSA: The Local Security Authority (LSA) initiates the interactive logon use case by

submitting user credentials.

  Front-end server: A front-end server contacts Authentication Services to get the authentication

token for the back-end server on behalf of the client's identity.

  Back-end server: The back-end server depends on Authentication Services to validate the

authentication token submitted by the server on behalf of the client's identity.

  Authentication Client: The client application(s) and the LSA interact with Authentication

Services by playing the roles of the "Authentication Client" actor.

2.5.3  Interactive Logon

2.5.3.1  Single Domain

The following subsection describes interactive domain logon in a single domain environment use case.

2.5.3.1.1 Interactive Domain Logon: Service Ticket for Client Computer

The LSA initiates this use case with the goal of proving the identity of a user to the Authentication
Authority (AA) and of getting a service ticket that contains user logon information from the AA for
the client computer. The user provides the credential material information, which includes the
identification and proof of that identification.

Goal: To get the service ticket for a client computer.

Context of Use: Applies when the user interactively logs on to the domain.

Direct Actor: The LSA.

Primary Actor: The user.

Supporting Actors: The AA and the account database (DB).

Preconditions:







The client computer is joined to a domain.

The identity of the user is configured in the account database.

The client computer and the AA can communicate with each other.

Minimal Guarantee: The LSA sends an error message to the user when the submitted credentials
do not match the ones that are stored in the account database or when the interactive domain
logon process fails.

Success Guarantee: The LSA receives a service ticket for the client computer.

Trigger: The user attempts to log on interactively to the client computer.

Main Success Scenario:

1.  The identity of the user is proven to the AA as described in section 2.5.5.1.

2.  The LSA requests a service ticket for the client computer by including a Kerberos

authenticator and the TGT that was received in the preceding step in a Kerberos request
and sending the request to the AA.

3.  The AA validates the request and returns a service ticket for the client computer.

Postconditions: The LSA has received a service ticket for the client computer, which contains user

logon information.

Extensions: None.

Alternative Scenario: The following scenario occurs when Kerberos authentication fails.

1.  The LSA submits a Netlogon message to prove the identity of the user to the AA. The

message includes the identity of the user and a one-way hash of the password ([MS-NRPC]
section 2.2.1.4.3).

2.  The AA verifies the user identity and password hash against the account DB and returns the

user logon information.

2.5.3.2  Multiple Domains

The following subsection describes a use case that pertains to interactive domain logon in a cross-
domain environment. For example, a user account is provisioned in one domain (domain1), a client
computer is joined to another domain (domain2), and both domains are in the same forest. A user
attempts to log on interactively to a machine that is joined to domain2. In this use case, AA1 denotes
the Authentication Authority (AA) of domain1, AA2 denotes the AA of domain2, and Account DB
#1 and Account DB #2 denote the account databases for domain1 and domain2, respectively. For a
similar example, see section 2.5.4.2 and use case diagram section 2.5.4.2.1.

2.5.3.2.1 Interactive Domain Logon: Service Ticket for Client Computer

The LSA initiates this use case with the goal of proving the identity of a user to the Authentication
Authority (AA) and of getting a service ticket that contains user logon information from the AA for
the client computer. The user provides the credential material information, which includes the
identification and proof of that identification.

Goal: To get the service ticket for a client computer.

Context of Use: Applies when the user and computer accounts are in different domains and when

the user interactively logs on to the domain.

Direct Actor: The LSA.

Primary Actor: The user.

Supporting Actors: AA1, AA2, Account DB #1, and Account DB #2. See similar diagram section

2.5.4.2.1.





The client computer is joined to domain2.

The identity of the user is configured in Account DB #1.

  Both domains exist in the same forest.

Minimal Guarantee: The LSA sends an error message to the user when the submitted credentials
do not match the ones stored in the account databases or when the interactive domain logon
process fails.

Success Guarantee: The LSA receives a service ticket for the client computer.

Trigger: The user attempts to log on interactively to the client computer.

Main Success Scenario:

1.  The identity of the user is proven to AA1 as described in section 2.5.5.1.

2.  The LSA requests a service ticket for the client computer by including a Kerberos

authenticator and the TGT that was received in the preceding step in a Kerberos request
and by sending it to AA1.

3.  AA1 cannot issue the service ticket for the client computer because it is joined to domain2

and only AA2 can do so; therefore, AA1 replies with a referral ticket for domain2, as
described in [Referrals].

4.  On receiving the referral ticket, the LSA locates AA2 and sends a TGS request that includes

the referral ticket.

5.  AA2 decrypts the referral ticket by using the inter-domain key that is shared between AA1

and AA2, detects that the referral ticket contains a request for a service ticket for the client
computer, generates the service ticket, and returns it to the client computer.

Postcondition: The LSA has received a service ticket for the client computer, which contains user

logon information.

Extensions: None.

application's identity and the TGT material that was obtained in step 2 and then sends it to
the AA to request a service ticket for the target server application.

5.  The AA locates the identity of the server application in its account DB and returns a service

ticket and a session key to the client application in a FAST TGS-REP message.

6.  The client application builds the authenticator by using a session key and sends an AP-REQ
([RFC4120] section 5.5.1) message that contains the service ticket plus the authenticator to

request a service ticket for the server application.

4.  The AA receives a compound identity TGS-REQ for a server application that supports

compound identity, verifies the request, and then adds the computer's authorization data
to the privilege attribute certificate (PAC) in the service ticket. The AA returns a service
ticket and a session key to the client application.

5.  The client application builds the authenticator by using a session key and sends the service

ticket plus the authenticator in an AP-REQ message to the target application.

6.  The server application verifies the authenticity of the client application identity and extracts

the group information, user claims, and device claims from the service ticket.

Alternative Scenario: Negotiation leads to the use of NTLM

1.  The client and server application negotiate authentication protocols, as described in section

2.5.5.2, and agree on NTLM as the authentication protocol.

2.  The client application requests the server to establish an authenticated session by using its

identity.

configured with the Digest or SSL/TLS authentication protocols and are not configured with the
Negotiate authentication protocol.

Alternative Scenario: Digest Protocol Extensions

1.  The client application sends an application-protocol-specific request to access a protected

resource of the server application.

2.  The server application validates the request and returns a digest challenge message to the
client. This message includes the randomly generated nonce and the domain name of the
server.

3.  The client obtains the user name (for example, User123) and a password for the user and

constructs a response to the server's challenge. In the digest response, the client proves
that it has acquired the user's password by performing a keyed hash over the user name,
nonce, and other fields (the password is fed into the hash).

4.  The server application sends the response and the nonce that was received in step 3 to the

AA for validation.

5.  The AA validates the request message by interacting locally with the account DB and

responds to the server application with the group membership information.

6.  The server application sends the response messages that were received in step 5 to the

client application.

Figure 18: Server authentication use case

Goal: To verify the identity of the server application.

Context of Use: The client application has to establish a secure session with the server application

by verifying the identity of the server application.

Direct Actor: The client application.

Primary Actor: The user.

Supporting Actors: The AA, the server application, and the PKI.

Preconditions:





The server application has a valid certificate from a trusted certificate authority.

The client application, server application, and the AA can communicate with each other.

Minimal Guarantee: When the server authentication fails, the server application receives an

error message that indicates the reason for the failure.

Success Guarantee: The server application has proven its identity to the client application.

Trigger: The user has to securely access resources on the server computer.

Main Success Scenario: Using the SSL/TLS Protocol

1.  The client application asks the server application to establish a secure session.

2.  The server application submits an X.509 certificate to the client application.

3.  By using PKI services, the client application verifies the validity, the issuing authority, and
the public key of the certificate and confirms that the domain name of the certificate
matches the domain name of the server. The client application generates a premaster
secret, encrypts it with the public key from the server's X.509 certificate, and sends it to the
server.

The user that started the client application is logged on to the client computer.

Minimal Guarantees: If client authentication fails, the client application receives an error

message that indicates the reason for the failure. If server authentication fails, the server
application receives an error message that indicates the reason for the failure.

Success Guarantee: The identities of the client and the server application are authenticated to

each other.

Trigger: The user has to securely access the protected resources or services of the server

application.

Main Success Scenario: Negotiation leads to Kerberos

1.  The identity of the client application is authenticated to the server application as described in
the main or alternative scenarios of section 2.5.4.1.1, and the client application requests the
server application to prove its identity to the client application.

2.  The server application returns the authenticator. It includes the client's time stamp
([RFC4120] section 3.2.4), which is encrypted with an agreed-on session key.

3.  The client application verifies the server application identity by decrypting the authenticator
with the session key. If the verification succeeds, the server application is authenticated.

Alternative Scenario: Mutual authentication by using SSL/TLS

1.  The client application asks the server application to establish a secure session.

2.  The server application sends an X.509 certificate and a nonce to the client application.

3.  By using PKI services, the client application verifies the validity, the issuing authority, and

the public key of the certificate and confirms that the DNS name in the certificate matches
the DNS name of the server. The client application signs the server's nonce with the user's
private key, generates a premaster secret, encrypts it with the public key of the server's
X.509 certificate, and sends both the signed nonce and the encrypted premaster secret to
the server, along with its X.509 certificate.

4.  By using PKI services, the server application verifies the validity, the issuing authority, and
the public key of the certificate and confirms the signature on its nonce. If the signature
verification succeeds, then the identity of the user is authenticated. The server application
then decrypts the premaster key with the private key that is associated with its certificate,
constructs a symmetric session key from the premaster secret and signs all of the previous
messages with it, and sends the signature to the client.

5.  The client checks the signature. If the signature verification succeeds, then the identity of

the server application is authenticated.

Postcondition: Both the client and the server application have a shared session key with which to

establish a secure session.

Extensions: None.

2.5.4.1.4 Delegation of Authentication

Delegation of authentication is accomplished in one of four ways. In the first, the client gets a
service ticket for the back-end server and gives it to the front-end server. Tickets obtained in this
way—by using the client as a proxy—are called proxy tickets. The difficulty with using proxy tickets is
that the client is provided with the name of the back-end server, and the client cannot determine
whether to allow the delegation. Windows clients do not use the proxy tickets mechanism.

[MS-AUTHSOD] - v20211026
Authentication Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2021 Microsoft Corporation
Release: October 26, 2021

56 / 94

The second method of delegation overcomes the difficulty with using proxy tickets. It allows the client
to give the front-end server a TGT that the front-end server can use to request service tickets for the
back-end server as they are required. Service tickets that are obtained in this way—with credentials
forwarded by a client—are called forwarded tickets. The Kerberos policy that an administrator sets for
the domain determines whether the KDC allows clients to obtain proxy tickets or TGTs that can be
forwarded.

In the other two methods, the front-end server does not require the user to forward either the TGT or
the proxy tickets to access the services of the back-end server. In other words, a user does not have
to have either a TGT or proxy service tickets. This initial condition means that the user is not required
to use the Kerberos protocol to authenticate.

The following use cases describe how the client delegates authentication to a front-end server by
informing the KDC that the front-end server is authorized to represent the client to access the back-
end server resources.

Figure 20: Delegation of authentication use case

Goal: To delegate authentication of the client identity to the front-end server to access the

resources or services of the back-end server on behalf of the client's identity.

Context of Use: The front-end server has to access resources or services on the back-end server

on behalf of the identity of the client application to fulfill the client application request.

Direct Actor: The client application or the front-end server depending on the chosen delegation

mechanism.

ticket and a forwarded TGT.

2.  To fulfill the client application request, the front-end server has to access the back-end

server to perform some action on behalf of the identity of the user that is running the client
application. The front-end server application asks the AA for a service ticket for the back-
end server in the name of the client's identity by presenting the forwarded TGT that was

Main Success Scenario: The client application has obtained a service ticket for the front-end

server.

1.  The client application makes a request to the front-end server that requires eventual access

to resources on the back-end server. The client application includes a service ticket for the
front-end server in the request.

2.  The front-end server requests the AA for the service ticket of the back-end server on behalf
of the identity of the user that is running the client application. The user is identified by the
client name and the client realm in the service ticket for the front-end server.

3.  The KDC validates the request and issues a service ticket for the back-end server.

4.  The front-end server application uses the service ticket to send a request to the back-end
server application. The back-end server treats this request as coming from the user and
proceeds as if the user had connected directly and had been authenticated by the AA.

5.  The back-end server application responds to the request.

Postcondition: The front-end server can successfully prove the identity of the user who is running

the client application to the back-end server.

Extensions: The client application has proven its identity to the front-end server by using a non-

Kerberos protocol.





The user that started the client application is logged on to the client computer.

The identity of the client application is configured in Account DB #1, and the identity of the
server application is configured in Account DB #2.



The client application, server application, AA1, and AA2 can communicate with each other.

Minimal Guarantee: When client authentication fails, the client application receives an error

message that indicates the reason for the failure.

Success Guarantee: The server application has verified the identity of the client application.

Trigger: The user has to access a protected resource or a service on the server computer that

resides in domain2.

Main Success Scenario: Negotiation leads to the use of Kerberos.

1.  The client and server application negotiate, as described in section 2.5.5.2, and agree on

Kerberos as the authentication protocol.

2.  The identity of the client application is proven to AA1, as described in section 2.5.5.1.

3.  The client application sends the target server application's identity and the TGT material
that was obtained in step 2 to AA1 to request a service ticket for the server application.

4.  AA1 cannot issue the service ticket for the identity of the server application because the

server identity is not defined in Account DB #1; therefore, AA1 replies with a referral ticket
to AA2, as described in [Referrals].

5.  When the client application receives the referral ticket, the client application locates AA2 and

sends the TGS request with the received referral ticket.

6.  AA2 decrypts the referral ticket by using the inter-domain key that is shared between AA1

and AA2, detects that the referral ticket contains a request for a service ticket for the server
application, generates the service ticket, and returns it to the client.

Postconditions: The identity of the client application is proven to the server application. Both the
client and the server applications have a shared session key for further secure communication.

Extensions: None.

Preconditions:





The user that started the client application is logged on to the client computer, which is in
forest1.

The identities of the client application and the client computer are configured in DB #1, and
the identity of the server application is configured in DB #2.

  Bidirectional forest trust is established between forest1 and forest2.

Minimal Guarantee: When client authentication fails, the client application receives an error

message that indicates the reason for the failure.

Success Guarantee: The server application has verified the identity of the client application.

Trigger: The user has to access a protected resource or a service on the server computer that

resides in domain2 in forest2.

Main Success Scenario: Negotiation leads to the use of Kerberos.

1.  The client and server applications negotiate as described in section 2.5.5.2 and agree on

Kerberos as the authentication protocol.

2.  The identity of the client application is proven to AA1, as described in the Main Success

Scenario in section 2.5.5.1.

3.  The client application sends the target server application's identity and the TGT material
that was obtained in step 2 to AA1 to request a service ticket for the server application.

4.  AA1 cannot find an entry for the server application identity in DB #1 and requests the GC

server to verify the server application identity. The GC server replies that the service is
located in forest2; therefore, AA1 sends the referral ticket to the root authority of forest1
(FAA1).

5.  On receiving the referral ticket, the client application locates FAA1 and sends the TGS

request with the received referral ticket.

6.  FAA1 double-checks with the local GC as to whether the identity of the server application is
in forest1. After FAA1 confirms that the identity does not exist in forest1, FAA1 sends the
referral ticket to the root authority of forest2 (FAA2).

7.  FAA2 double-checks with the local GC as to whether the identity of the server application is
in forest2. After FAA2 confirms that the identity of the server application exists in domain2,
FAA2 sends the referral ticket to domain2 (AA2) in forest2.

8.  AA2 validates the client’s identity through the referral TGT, filters out all SIDs that are not
local to the client’s identity home forest, and sends the response with the service ticket of
the requested server application to the client application.

Postconditions: The identity of the client application is proven to the server application. Both the
client and the server application have a shared session key for further secure communication.

Extensions: None.

2.5.5.1.1 Authenticate Client Identity by Using a User Name and Password

The following describes authentication of a client user or computer by using a user name and

password.

Goal: To authenticate the identity of a user or computer to the AA by providing a user name or

computer name and a password.

Context of Use: Applies when the user interactively logs on to the domain or when the user tries

to access a protected resource on the network.

Direct Actor: The Authentication Client.

Primary Actor: The LSA or the client application.

Supporting Actors: The AA, the account DB, and the PKI.

Preconditions:







The identities of the user and the client computer are configured in the account database.

The client computer and the AA can communicate with each other.

The LSA has obtained the credential information for the user or computer identity and has
submitted the credential information to the Authentication Client. In the case of user identity
authentication, the LSA has obtained the credential information from the user (for example,
by using a logon UI).

[MS-AUTHSOD] - v20211026
Authentication Services Protocols Overview
Copyright © 2021 Microsoft Corporation
Release: October 26, 2021

Minimal Guarantees: If the identity of the user or computer cannot be proven to the AA by using
the underlying authentication protocol, authentication fails. The client application or the user
receives an error message that indicates the reason for the failure.

Success Guarantees: The client computer has a TGT for the user or computer account, which is
used to authenticate to servers. The user or computer identity is successfully proven to the
client computer, and the client computer has group information and other information about the
user.

Main Success Scenario: Using the Kerberos Protocol

1.  To prove the identity of the user or computer, the Authentication Client submits to the AA

credential information including a user name or computer account name, a timestamp that is
encrypted with a key derived from the user's or computer's password, and a domain name.

2.  The AA verifies the credential information against the account DB. When verification

succeeds, the AA returns to the Authentication Client a TGT and a session keyencrypted
with a key that is derived from the user's or computer's password.

Alternative Scenario: This scenario occurs when FAST mode is supported and configured on both
the Authentication Client and when the AA and the Authentication Client have obtained the TGT
for the computer account, as described in the Main Success Scenario.

1.  To prove the user identity, the Authentication Client submits to the AA a FAST AS-REQ

message that contains user credential information. The information includes a user name, a
timestamp that is encrypted with a key derived from the user's password, and a domain
name.

2.  The AA verifies the user credential information against the account database. When

verification succeeds, the AA returns a FAST AS-REP message to the Authentication Client.
FAST AS-REP is a Kerberos AS-REP message ([RFC4120] section 3.1) that contains a TGT
and a session key encrypted with a key derived from the user's password.

Postconditions: The user or computer identity is proven to the AA, and the Authentication Client

receives a TGT and a session key for further authentication processing.

2.5.5.1.2 Authenticate Client Identity by Using an X.509 Certificate

The following describes authentication of a client user or computer by using an X.509 certificate in
the Main Success Scenario, otherwise the section is the same as section 2.5.5.1.1.

Goal: To authenticate the identity of a user or computer to the AA by using an X.509 certificate.

Context of Use: Applies when the user interactively logs on to the domain or when the user tries

to access a protected resource on the network.

Direct Actor: The Authentication Client.

Primary Actor: The LSA or the client application.

Supporting Actors: The AA, the account DB, and the PKI.

Preconditions:







The identities of the user and the client computer are configured in the account database.

The client computer and the AA can communicate with each other.

The LSA has obtained the credential information for the user or computer identity and has
submitted the credential information to the Authentication Client. In the case of user identity

authentication, the LSA has obtained the credential information from the user (for example, by
using a logon UI).

Minimal Guarantees: If the identity of the user or computer cannot be proven to the AA by using
the underlying authentication protocol, authentication fails. The client application or the user
receives an error message that indicates the reason for the failure.

Success Guarantee: The client computer has a TGT for the user or computer account, which is
used to authenticate to servers. The user or computer identity is successfully proven to the
client computer, and the client computer has group information and other information about the
user.

Main Success Scenario:

1.  To prove the identity of the user or computer by using PKI services, the Authentication

Client submits to the AA user or computer credential information that consists of the user
name or computer account name, the domain name, the user's or computer's X.509
certificate, and a timestamp that is signed by using the certificate.

2.  The AA validates the certificate chain, verifies the signature on the timestamp by using PKI
services, and then looks up the account in the account DB. When verification succeeds, the
AA returns to the Authentication Client a TGT and a session key encrypted with the public
key of the user's certificate.

Postconditions: The user or computer identity is proven to the AA, and the Authentication Client

receives a TGT and a session key for further authentication processing

2.5.5.2  Negotiate Authentication Protocol

The Negotiate Authentication Protcol use case describes how a client and a server application can
negotiate to select an agreed-on common authentication protocol.

Figure 25: Negotiate authentication protocol

Goal: To select an authentication protocol that both the client computer and server computer

system support.

Context of Use: A client application has to access a service on a network that requires verification
of client identities, and the client and server applications are coded to use SPNEGO to negotiate
a common authentication protocol.

Direct Actor: The client application or the server application, depending on how negotiation starts.

The user that started the client application is logged on to the client computer.

The client application, server application, and AA can communicate with each other.

The client and server application are configured to negotiate an authentication protocol.

Minimal Guarantees: Negotiation fails in some scenarios when a non-Windows system

participates and there is no common protocol, or when the client or server application receives
another reason for failure.

Success Guarantee: Both the client and the server agree on a common authentication protocol.

Trigger: The client application has to access a protected resource or a service on the server

computer and: a) The client starts the negotiation phase before a request; or b) The server
starts the negotiation phase in reaction to a request; or c) The server rejects access, and the
client initiates the negotiation phase. The trigger depends on the implementation of the
application protocol.

Main Success Scenario: The server starts the negotiation phase in reaction to a request.

1.  The server application sends the preferred authentication protocol and a list of available

authentication protocols in priority order to the client application.

2.  The client application sends the preferred authentication protocol and a list of available

authentication protocols in priority order to the server application.

3.  The server application agrees on a common protocol and returns the state of negotiation to

the client application.

Postcondition: Both the client and server application have agreed on a common authentication

protocol for further authentication process.

Extensions: None.

2.5.5.3  S4U2self Mechanism: Get a Service Ticket for a Front-End Server

This use case describes how a front-end server obtains a service ticket to itself on behalf of the
identity of a client application by using the S4U2self mechanism ([MS-SFU] section 1.3.1) when the
identity of the client application is proven to the front-end server by some means other than

and both the client and the server application interpret the application data in an
implementation-specific way.

2.6  Versioning, Capability Negotiation, and Extensibility

No capability negotiation is associated with Authentication Services. Any deviations from a specific
version's implementation of these protocol specifications are documented in the respective protocol
document. Capability negotiations between client and server implementations of these protocols are
specified in the System Versioning and Capability Negotiation sections in their respective technical
documents. For more details, see sections 1.7 of the member protocol specifications that are listed in
section 2.2.

2.7  Error Handling

Authentication Services do not handle errors at the system level for cross-protocol error states. The
member protocol specifications describe the errors that the protocols return and what they mean. The
implementer determines how to handle the errors, based on the protocol descriptions.

2.8  Coherency Requirements

None.

2.9  Security

Implementers have to be aware that Kerberos Protocol Extensions [MS-KILE] and public key-based
authentication ([MS-PKCA] and [MS-TLSP]) offer stronger security guarantees in terms of initial
authentication and in subsequent confidentiality and integrity of client-server traffic and server-server
traffic. Digest authentication or NTLM authentication can be used in environments in which these
stronger mechanisms are not available.

Because the security of Kerberos authentication is in part based upon the time stamps of the tickets,
it is critical to have accurately set clocks on the machines in the Kerberos environment. As stated in
the Kerberos documents, a short lifetime for tickets is used to prevent attackers from performing
successful brute force attacks or replay attacks. If the clocks of the machines in a Kerberos
environment drift, the network becomes vulnerable to such attacks. Because clock synchronization is
vital to Kerberos protocol security, if clocks are not synchronized within a reasonable time window,
Kerberos will report fatal errors and refuse to function.

In Windows, the Network Time Protocol (NTP) Authentication Extensions [MS-SNTP] is used to achieve
authenticated time synchronization between Kerberos clients and the KDC. Client authentication
attempts from a machine with an inaccurate clock will be rejected by the KDC because of the time
difference with the KDC's clock; therefore, it is important to achieve time synchronization.

3  Examples

3.1  Example 1: GSS Authentication Protocol Process - Stock Quote Server

This example describes the GSS authentication protocol process. It builds on the use cases for Client
Authentication (section 2.5.4.1.1), Server Authentication (section 2.5.4.1.2), Mutual
Authentication (section 2.5.4.1.3), Security Services: Data Origin Authentication
(Signing) (section 2.5.6.1), Security Services: Data Confidentiality (Sealing) (section 2.5.6.2), and
their dependent use cases.

Every application protocol uses its own mechanism to transport the GSS-API security tokens from an
Application Client to an Application Server. The following example explains the interactions of the
Authentication Client, the Authentication Server, and the Authentication Authority (AA)
through GSS-APIs [RFC2743].

This example is particularly useful for application architects and developers to design and implement
application protocols that interoperate with Authentication Services.

To illustrate the use of authentication, this example uses the simple Stock Quote Service block
protocol that specifies the retrieval and update of stock quotes from the Stock Quote Server.

The following table defines Stock Quote Request and Response messages without authentication data
support.

Field

Length

Field function

The length of the message

Message Type  The message type (3 is an error message; 1 is a reply; 0 is a request)

Request Type

The requested action (0 is a query; 1 is an update)

Stock Symbol

The stock symbol

Stock Price

The stock price (optional)

Error code

The error code (0 is success; nonzero is failure)

Table 1: Stock Quote Service messages without authentication data support

To get the latest stock quote price, the Stock Quote Client sends a request message, as defined in
Table 1, to the Stock Quote Server and receives a response message with a stock quote price. The
Stock Quote Server is not required to authenticate the client to respond with a stock quote price,
because anyone can query this server, but the client requires the server authentication,
confidentiality, and signing services so that the client can verify that the quote is valid and was
obtained from an authentic server and that the messages were not tampered with. These services
help to keep these interactions private.

The Stock Quote Server restricts stock price updates to authenticated users. To update a stock quote
price, the server requires client authentication; therefore, the client authenticates to the server. To
retrieve a stock quote price, the client requires server authentication; therefore, the server
authenticates to the client. Both the client and the server require the assurance that the messages
were not tampered with and that the message exchanges were secret; this assurance requires signing
and confidentiality services.

Because the application protocol is GSS API-conformant, it is required to support transport of the
authentication token.

The existing Stock Quote request and response messages are extended to hold authentication tokens
and protected application data messages.

The following table defines Stock Quote Request and Response messages with authentication data
support.

The length of the Data Blob field.

Data Blob

The data BLOB. The contents of this field are based on the Data Blob Type field.
If the Data Blob Type field is 1, then this field contains the binary BLOB of the authentication

If the Data Blob Type field is 2, then this field contains the Request Type (0 is query; 1 is
update), Stock Symbol, and Stock Price field values.
If the Data Blob Type field is 3 and the Message Type field is 3, then this message contains
an error code.

Table 2: Stock Quote Service messages with authentication data support

To update or retrieve the stock quote, a client and server exchange one or more request and response
messages with an authentication token in the Data Blob field depending on the underlying
authentication protocol. When authentication finishes, the client or server sends the Data Blob field
with application data that contains stock quote details. If the initial request message does not have an
authentication token, the server returns an error code, because authentication is required.

Prerequisites

This example assumes the following prerequisites in addition to the preconditions of the covered use
cases:

  A TCP connection is established between the Stock Quote Client and the Stock Quote Server.



The Stock Quote Client and the Stock Quote Server have acquired the credential handles with
the GSS-API GSS_Acquire_Cred function ([RFC2743] section 2.1.1) by specifying the security
package.

Initial System State



The AA has not authenticated the client identity or the server identity.

Final System State



The AA has authenticated both the client and the server identities.

Sequence of Events

The following steps show the basics of authentication with GSS.

Figure 29: GSS authentication process with underlying authentication protocol messages

Step 1: The Stock Quote Client calls the Authentication Client's GSS-API GSS_Init_sec_context
function ([RFC2743] section 2.2.1) to obtain the security token with the acquired credential handle
and null input token by specifying that it requires mutual authentication, confidentiality, and
signing.

Step 2: If the Authentication Client requires information from the Authentication Authority (AA) (that
is, the DC) before returning the token, the Authentication Client generates authentication messages
and sends the messages to the AA. The AA validates the messages. If the messages are valid, the AA
generates an authentication message and sends the reply to the Authentication Client. If the
Authentication Client requires more information from the AA before returning the GSS-API token, step
2 is repeated until all the required information is obtained.

Step 3: The Authentication Client generates a new GSS-API token and if more messages are expected,
returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED. Otherwise, if this is the final message, returns
GSS_S_COMPLETE, and the security token to the Stock Quote Client.

Step 4: The Stock Quote Client embeds the security token in its application message and sends the
message to the Stock Quote Server by using its own application-protocol-specific method. In this
example, the Stock Quote Client embeds the security token in the Data Blob field, sets the Data
Blob Type field value to 1, sets the Message Type to 0, and sets the other required fields in the
stock quote service message, as described in Table 2.

Step 5: The Stock Quote Server calls the Authentication Server's GSS-API GSS_Accept_sec_context
function ([RFC2743] section 2.2.2) with the acquired credential handle and security token from the
client by specifying the Confidentiality and Integrity flags.

Step 6: If required by the authentication protocol, the Authentication Server generates an
authentication message and sends the message to the AA. The AA validates the message. If the
message is valid, the AA generates an authentication message and sends the reply to the
Authentication Server.

If the Authentication Server requires more information from the AA before it returns the GSS-API
token, step 6 is repeated until all the required information is obtained.

Step 7: The Authentication Server validates the token. If the token is valid, the Authentication Server
generates a new token if required and



If more messages are expected, returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED,

or



If this is the final message, returns GSS_S_COMPLETE,

and the security token to the Stock Quote Server.

Step 8: If the Authentication Server returns a token, the Stock Quote Server embeds the security
token in its application message and sends the message to the Stock Quote Client by using its own
application-protocol-specific transport. In this example, the Stock Quote Server embeds the security
token in the Data Blob field, sets the Data Blob Type field value to 1, sets the Message Type field
to 1, and sets other required fields in the stock quote service message, as described in Table 2.

Step 9: If the Authentication Client had previously returned GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, the Stock
Quote Client calls the GSS_Init_sec_context function ([RFC2743] section 2.2.1) with the token from
the server.

Step 10: The Authentication Client validates the token. If the token is valid, the Authentication Client
generates a new token if required and



If more messages are expected, returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED,

or



If this is the final message, returns GSS_S_COMPLETE,

and the security token to the Stock Quote Client.

If GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, go to Step 5.

Step 11: The Stock Quote Client generates a Data Blob field that contains the updated stock quote
data and calls the Authentication Client's GSS-API GSS_Wrap function ([RFC2743] section 2.3.3) to
generate a privacy and integrity-protected copy of the application Data Blob field.

Step 12: The Authentication Client returns a privacy and integrity-protected copy of the application
Data Blob field.

Step 13: The Stock Quote Client builds the request message with the protected Data Blob field and
other required fields and sends the message to the Stock Quote Server by using its own application-
protocol-specific transport.

Step 14: The Stock Quote Server calls the Authentication Server's GSS-API GSS_Unwrap function
([RFC2743] section 2.3.4) to verify the integrity of the protected Data Blob field and also to get the
plain Data Blob field contents.

Step 15: The Authentication Server verifies the integrity of the message and returns the plain Data
Blob field contents to the Stock Quote Server. The Stock Quote Server interprets and updates the
stock information with the contents of the application Data Blob field.

Step 16: The Stock Quote Server calls the GSS_Wrap function ([RFC2743] section 2.3.3) with the
Data Blob to get the protected Data Blob field.

Step 17: The Authentication Server returns a protected Data Blob.

Step 18: The Stock Quote Server builds the response message with the protected Data Blob field and
also sets other required fields, as described in Table 2. The message is sent to the Stock Quote Client.

Step 19: The Stock Quote Client calls the GSS_Unwrap function ([RFC2743] section 2.3.4) to verify
the integrity of the message and also to get the plain Data Blob field contents.

Step 20: The Authentication Client returns the plain Data Blob field contents.

The Stock Quote Client interprets the response and ends the session. When finished, both the Stock
Quote Client and the Stock Quote Server release the credential handles by calling the GSS-API
GSS_Release_cred function ([RFC2743] section 2.1.2).

3.2  Example 2: Interactive Domain Logon - Service Ticket for Client Computer

The examples in the following subsections describe interactive domain logons to obtain service tickets.
They build on the use case for Interactive Domain Logon: Service Ticket for Client
Computer (section 2.5.3.1.1) by using a user name and password or an X.509 certificate.

Interactive domain logon can be performed several ways: through the Netlogon RPC interface [MS-
NRPC] with password-based authentication, through Kerberos [MS-KILE] [RFC4120] with passwords,
or through Kerberos PKINIT [MS-PKCA] [RFC4556] by using an X.509 certificate. The examples in the
following subsections show the password-based and the X.509 certificate-based Kerberos exchanges.

3.2.1  Interactive Domain Logon by Using Passwords

This example describes interactive logon by using a password to obtain a service ticket. It covers the
use cases Authenticate User or Computer Identity Using Username and Password (section 2.5.5.1.1)
and Interactive Domain Logon: Service Ticket for Client Computer (section 2.5.3.1.1).

Sequence of Events

Figure 30: Interactive domain logon that uses passwords

Authentication of User Identity to Authentication Authority by Using Kerberos (see section
2.5.5.1.1)

Step 1: The logon attempt is made through the Kerberos protocol. The Authentication Client (the
Kerberos client) sends a KRB_AS_REQ message ([RFC4120] section 3.1) to the Authentication
Authority (the Key Distribution Center (KDC)). This message includes the user principal name and
a list of supported encryption types in preferred priority order. This message does not include the pre-
authentication data because its function is to discover the supported encryption types.

Step 2: The KDC checks the user principal name in its account database. Because the request
message does not contain the pre-authentication data, the KDC responds with an error ([RFC4120]
section 3.1.3) and also with a list supported encryption types in its priority order.

Step 3: The Authentication Client sends a KRB_AS_REQ message for a ticket-granting ticket
(TGT) with PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP as pre-authentication data to the KDC. The client builds the pre-
authentication data by encrypting its timestamp with a secret key derived from the user's password
by using one of the commonly supported encryption methods.

Step 4: In response to receiving the KRB_AS_REQ message for a TGT, the KDC authenticates the
user by checking the pre-authentication data and ensuring that the credentials that are used in the
KRB_AS_REQ are the same as those of the user's credentials ([RFC4120] section 3.1) in the account
database. The KDC builds the TGT with a privilege attribute certificate (PAC) ([MS-KILE] section
3.3.5.6.4) that contains group membership information in the authorization_data field of the TGT,
generates a KRB_AS_REP message from the TGT and the session key, and sends the
KRB_AS_REP message back to the client.

Service Ticket for Client Computer (see section 2.5.3.1.1)

Step 5: The client sends a KRB_TGS_REQ message ([RFC4120] section 3.3) based on the TGT from
step 4 to obtain a service ticket for the target computer. The client presents the TGT, the
authenticator, and the service principal name (SPN) as host/hostname.domain, where hostname
is the actual name of the client computer, and domain is the domain or realm of the client computer.

Step 6: The KDC validates the TGT and the authenticator. If these are valid, the KDC returns a service
ticket for a client computer in a KRB_TGS_REP message with user logon information.

The client validates the KRB_TGS_REP message ([MS-KILE] section 3.3.4). If KRB_TGS_REP is
valid, then the Kerberos runtime interprets the service ticket within the local client computer.

3.2.2  Interactive Domain Logon by Using an X.509 Certificate

This example describes interactive domain logon by using an X.509 certificate to obtain a service
ticket. It covers the use cases Authenticate User or Computer Identity Using an X.509
Certificate (section 2.5.5.1.2) and Interactive Domain Logon: Service Ticket for Client
Computer (section 2.5.3.1.1).

Prerequisites





The Authentication Authority (AA) is available.

The Authentication Client has access to the X.509 certificate and private key of the requested
user account.

Initial System State





The user has not been authenticated to the AA.

The Authentication Client does not have a service ticket for the client computer.

Final System State



The AA has interactively authenticated the user, and the Authentication Client has obtained a
service ticket for the client computer.

Step 4: The KDC validates the KRB_AS_REQ message ([RFC4120] section 3.1.2), which includes
verifying the user's signature and validating the certificate ([RFC4556] section 3.2.2). If the
KRB_AS_REQ message is valid, the KDC builds the TGT with a PAC ([MS-KILE] section 3.3.5.6.4)
that contains group membership information in the authorization_data field of the TGT, generates a
KRB_AS_REP message ([RFC4556] section 3.2.3) from the TGT and the session key, and sends the
reply to the client.

Service Ticket for Client Computer (see section 2.5.3.1.1)

Step 5: Same as step 5 in section 3.2.1.

Step 6: Same as step 6 in section 3.2.1.

The client validates the KRB_TGS_REP message ([MS-KILE] section 3.3.4). If the KRB_TGS_REP
message is valid, the service ticket is interpreted by the Kerberos runtime within the local client
computer.

3.3  Example 3: Connecting to an SMB2 Share

The examples in the following subsections describe connecting to an SMB2 share by using Kerberos
protocol [MS-KILE] or NTLM protocol [MS-NLMP]. They build on the use cases for Network Logon:
Mutual Authentication (section 2.5.4.1.3), Network Logon: Client Authentication (section 2.5.4.1.1),
Security Services: Data Origin Authentication (Signing) (section 2.5.6.1), and their dependent use
cases.

3.3.1  Using Kerberos Protocol Extensions [MS-KILE]

This example describes using Kerberos protocol extensions [MS-KILE] to obtain client
authentication to connect to an SMB2 share.

Prerequisites

  A file share has been created on an SMB2 server, and the user that initiates the SMB2 client

application has been configured for access permissions on the share.

Initial System State



The user that is running the SMB2 client application has not been authenticated to the
Authentication Authority (AA).

Final System State



The user that is running the SMB2 client application has been authenticated to the AA.

Figure 32: Connecting to an SMB2 share with [MS-KILE] as the authentication protocol

Negotiating an Authentication Protocol (see section 2.5.5.2)

The SMB2 client and the SMB2 server negotiate the authentication protocol by using the SPNEGO
protocol [MS-SPNG] and [MS-NEGOEX].

Step 1: When the user tries to access the network share on the SMB2 server, the SMB2 client sends
the SMB2 NEGOTIATE Request message ([MS-SMB2] section 2.2.3) to the SMB2 server to
negotiate SMB2 capabilities, such as SMB dialects between the SMB2 client and server.

Step 2: The SMB2 server builds an SMB2 NEGOTIATE Response message ([MS-SMB2] section
2.2.4) with its preferred dialect and the securityBlob field with the GSS token by calling the
Authentication Server through the GSS-API GSS_Accept_sec_context function [RFC2743]. The
GSS token contains a NegTokenInit2 message ([MS-SPNG] section 2.2.1), which includes the
preferred authentication protocol mechanism as the NegoEx object identifier (OID) and a list of the
supported authentication mechanisms as NegoEx ([MS-NEGOEX]), krb5, erroneous Kerberos,
usertouser, and NTLM OIDs ([MS-SPNG] section 1.9.1).

The SMB2 client calls the Authentication Client through the GSS-API GSS_Init_sec_context
function ([RFC2743] section 2.2.1) to verify the received GSS token and to get the token to prove the
SMB2 client's identity to the SMB2 server. The Authentication Client first tries by using the Kerberos
protocol to prove the client's identity and to build the security token.

Authenticating an SMB2 Client Identity to a Kerberos Authentication Server (see section
2.5.5.1.1)

The Authentication Client proves the identity of the SMB2 client to the Authentication Authority by
using the Kerberos [MS-KILE] protocol to get the service ticket for the SMB2 server.

Step 3: The Authentication Client (Kerberos client) sends a KRB_AS_REQ message ([RFC4120]
section 3.1) to the Authentication Authority (Key Distribution Center (KDC)). This message
includes the user principal name and a list of supported encryption types in priority order to encrypt

Release: October 26, 2021

the pre-authentication data but does not include the pre-authentication data because its function is
to discover the supported encryption types.

Step 4: The KDC checks the user principal name in its account database and the pre-authentication
data. If the request message does not contain the pre-authentication data, the KDC responds with an
error ([RFC4120] section 3.1.3) and with a list of supported encryption types in its priority order.

Step 5: The Authentication Client sends a KRB_AS_REQ message for a ticket-granting ticket
(TGT) with PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP as pre-authentication data to the KDC. The client builds the pre-
authentication data by encrypting its timestamp with a secret key derived from the user's password
by using an agreed-on encryption method. The client presents its principal name and pre-
authentication data in a KRB_AS_REQ message.

Step 6: In response to receiving the KRB_AS_REQ for a TGT, the KDC authenticates the user by
checking that the pre-authentication data credentials that are used in the KRB_AS_REQ are the
same as those of the user's credentials ([RFC4120] section 3.1) in the account database. The KDC
builds the TGT with a PAC ([MS-KILE] section 3.3.5.6.4) that contains group membership information
in the authorization_data field of the TGT, generates a KRB_AS_REP message ([RFC4556] section
3.2.2) from the TGT and the session key, and sends the KRB_AS_REP message back to the client.

Authenticating an SMB2 Client Identity to an SMB2 Server (see section 2.5.4.1.1)

Step 7: The Authentication Client sends a KRB_TGS_REQ based on the TGT obtained in step 6 to
obtain a service ticket for the SMB2 server. The KRB_TGS_REQ message includes the TGT, the
authenticator, and the Service Principal Name (SPN) as cifs/servername.domain, where
servername is the actual name of the SMB2 server computer, and domain is the domain or realm of
the client computer.

Step 8: The KDC validates the TGT and the authenticator. If these are valid, the KDC returns a service
ticket for an SMB2 server and a session key for communication between the SMB2 client and the
SMB2 server in a KRB_TGS_REP message.

Step 9: The Authentication Client builds a KRB_AP_REQ message ([RFC4120] section 3.2) with a
TGT and the authenticator that is created by encrypting the user name, IP address, and a timestamp
with the session key received in step 8. This entire KRB_AP_REQ message, with a MutualRequired
flag to indicate that the server authentication is required, is embedded as a KerberosToken in a
NegTokenInit message ([RFC4178] section 4.2.1), along with a preferred authentication mechanism,
such as krb5, and a list of supported authentication mechanisms, such as krb5, erroneous Kerberos,
NegoEx, and NTLM OIDs. This entire NegTokenInit message is enveloped in a GSS-API SPNEGO
token and returned to the SMB2 client.

To get a new authenticated session, the SMB2 client sends the SMB2 server an SMB2
SESSION_SETUP Request message ([MS-SMB2] section 2.2.5) with its SecurityMode field set to
SMB2_NEGOTIATE_SIGNING_ENABLED. The request message contains a securityBlob field that
contains the GSS SPNEGO token that was constructed previously, as well as other capabilities and a
security mode.

The SMB2 server calls the Authentication Server on the local machine to verify the client's identity by
validating the GSS-API SPNEGO token. The Authentication Server validates the SPNEGO Token
contents by calling the GSS_Accept_sec_context function ([RFC2743] section 2.2.2) with the
received token. If the validation succeeds, the client identity is proved to the SMB2 server, and the
Authentication Server returns the security token to the SMB2 server.

Proving SMB2 server identity to the SMB2 client application (see section 2.5.4.1.2)

Step 10: The SMB2 server generates a signature as described in [MS-SMB2] section 3.1.4.1 and sends
the SMB2 client an SMB2 SESSION_SETUP Response message ([MS-SMB2] section 2.2.6). The
response contains the signature and the previously received GSS security token, which contains a
negTokenResp ([RFC4178] section 4.2.2), which has a KRB_AP_REP message ([RFC4120] section
3.2.4) as its KerberosToken.

The SMB2 client calls the Authentication Client's GSS-API GSS_Init_sec_context function
([RFC2743] section 2.2.1) to verify the GSS token to prove the identity of the SMB2 server and
verifies the signature as described in [MS-SMB2] section 3.1.5.1. The Authentication Client verifies the
signature and the GSS token as described in [MS-SPNG] and [MS-NEGOEX] and then validates the
KRB_AP_REP message. If the validation succeeds, the identity of the server is proven to the SMB2
client.

3.3.2  Using the NTLM Protocol [MS-NLMP]

This example describes using NTLM Protocol [MS-NLMP] to obtain client authentication to connect
to an Server Message Block (SMB2) share. When Kerberos authentication fails or is not
configured, the Authentication Client tries the NTLM protocol as the next preferred authentication
protocol to prove the identity of the SMB2 client to the SMB2 server. This example describes the
interactions between the SMB2 client and the SMB2 server when Kerberos is not configured or is
unavailable.

Prerequisites

  A file share has been created on an SMB2 server, and the user that initiates the SMB2 client

application has been configured for access permissions on the share.

Initial System State



The user that is running the SMB2 client application has not been authenticated to the
Authentication Authority (AA).

Final System State



The user that is running the SMB2 client application has been authenticated to the AA.

Figure 33: Connecting to an SMB2 share with [MS-NLMP] as the authentication protocol

The SMB2 client and the SMB2 server negotiate the authentication protocol by using the SPNEGO
protocol [MS-SPNG] and [MS-NEGOEX].

Step 1: When the user tries to access the network share on the SMB2 server, the SMB2 client sends
the SMB2 NEGOTIATE Request ([MS-SMB2] section 2.2.3) message to the SMB2 server to
negotiate SMB2 capabilities, such as SMB dialects between the SMB2 client and server

Step 2: The SMB2 server builds an SMB2 NEGOTIATE Response ([MS-SMB2] section 2.2.4)
message with a preferred dialect and a securityBlob field with the GSS token by calling the
Authentication Server through the GSS-API GSS_Accept_sec_context function, as described in
[RFC2743]. The GSS token contains a NegTokenInit2 ([MS-SPNG] section 2.2.1) message, which
includes the preferred authentication protocol mechanism as NegoEx OID and a list of supported
authentication mechanisms such as NegoEx ([MS-NEGOEX]), krb5, erroneous Kerberos, usertouser,
and NLMP OIDs, as specified in [MS-SPNG] section 1.9.1.

Step 3: The SMB2 client calls the GSS-API GSS_Init_sec_context function ([RFC2743] section
2.2.1) of the Authentication Client to verify the received token and to obtain the new GSS SPNEGO
Token. Next, the Authentication Client builds the GSS token with NTLM as its preferred authentication
mechanism and a NEGOTIATE_MESSAGE ([MS-NLMP] section 2.2.1.1) and hands off to the SMB2
client. The SMB2 client creates an SMB2 SESSION_SETUP Request ([MS-SMB2] section 2.2.5) with
securityBlob field values as the GSS token and sends it to the SMB2 server.

Step 4: The SMB2 server asks the Authentication Server to validate the GSS token that was received
in the preceding step by calling the GSS-API GSS_Accept_sec_context function ([RFC2743] section

2.2.2). The Authentication Server validates the security token and returns the status code that
indicates that a subsequent round trip is required. It also builds the GSS SPNEGO token with a
CHALLENGE_MESSAGE ([MS-NLMP] section 2.2.1.2), which is returned to the SMB2 server. The
SMB2 server creates an SMB2 SESSION_SETUP Response ([MS-SMB2] section 2.2.6) with the
security field value as the GSS token and sends the response to the SMB2 client.

Step 5: The SMB2 client calls the GSS-API GSS_Init_sec_context function ([RFC2743] section
2.2.1) of the Authentication Client to validate the security token that was received in step 4 and to
build the subsequent security token. The Authentication Client builds the GSS-API SPNEGO token with
an AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE ([MS-NLMP] section 2.2.1.3). The SMB2 client creates the SMB2
SESSION_SETUP Request with the GSS token and sends it to the SMB2 server.

Step 6: The SMB2 server calls the GSS-API GSS_Accept_sec_context function ([RFC2743] section
2.2.2) of the Authentication Server to validate the received token and builds security tokens if
required for further communication. To validate the security token, the Authentication Server contacts
the Authentication Authority by sending a NETWORK_NETLOGON_INFO message as described in
[MS-APDS] section 2.2.1.

Step 7: The Authentication Authority validates the request message and returns either the
NETLOGON_VALIDATION_SAM_INFO2 or the NETLOGON_VALIDATION_SAM_INFO4 message
with group membership information to the Authentication Server, depending on the processing rules
described in [MS-APDS] section 3.1.5.2.

Step 8: The Authentication Server returns the status indicating that authentication is complete to the
SMB2 server. The SMB2 server builds the SMB2 SESSION_SETUP Response message and sends it
to the SMB2 client.

1  Introduction

The Storage Services protocols consist of a set of protocols for configuring and administering storage
services operations in the Windows operating system, such as managing disks and volumes, backing
up data, restoring data, managing the Media library, and encrypting and decrypting files. The
member protocols of this system manage the low-level storage services operations and can be used
programmatically to enumerate and configure disks, volumes, host bus adapter (HBA) ports, and
iSCSI initiators on remote computers.

Before the introduction of Disk Management services<1>, each storage device, such as the hard disk,
the peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus, the redundant arrays of independent disks
(RAID) adapter, and the storage array system, provided its own installation and management
application. The Disk Management services provide a unified interface that simplifies the management
of dissimilar storage devices.

1.1  Conceptual Overview

Data that is stored on servers is critically important for the day-to-day activities of any organization.
This data needs to be accessed, stored, and recovered reliably. In response to the expanding
requirements for storage in distributed computing environments, the Windows operating system
supports different storage technologies for storing, accessing, and managing data on servers. For
information about storage technologies, see [MSDN-STC].

This section provides an overview of the following concepts, which are required for understanding this
overview:





File systems technologies

File shares

  Disks and volumes

  Removable storage

 File systems technologies

A file system is the structure in which files are named, stored, and organized. Examples for file
systems are the FAT16, FAT32, and NTFS file systems. They can be used in any combination on a
hard disk, but each volume on a hard disk can use only one file system.

The NTFS file system provides performance, reliability, and advanced features that are not found in
any version of the FAT file system. For example, NTFS includes built-in security features such as file
and folder permissions and the Encrypting File System (EFS), which is the technology that is used
to store encrypted files on NTFS volumes. NTFS also provides support for volumes up to 256 terabytes
in size, support for disk quotas and compression, and support for mounted drives. For more
information about EFS, see [MSFT-EFS].

File shares

A file share represents a directory tree and its included files. It is a local resource that is offered by a
file server and is consumed by a client application by using the File Access Services protocols, as
described in [MS-FASOD].

 Disks and volumes

A disk is a storage device that stores and provides access to large amounts of data. There are two
types of disks for storing information: a basic disk and a dynamic disk. For more information about
disk management, see [MSDN-DISKMAN].

5 / 51

Release: October 26, 2021

A volume is an area on a storage device that is managed by the file system as a discrete logical
storage unit. For more information about volume management, see [MSDN-VOLMAN].

 Removable storage

Removable storage is an abstract component that is used to track removable storage media such as
tapes and optical disks and to manage the hardware libraries that contain them by using changers and
jukeboxes.

Removable storage components can perform the following operations:



Label, catalog, and track media

  Control library drives, slots, and doors



Perform drive-cleaning operations

Removable storage components interact with data management applications such as Backup.
Removable storage components enable multiple applications to share storage media resources, which
can reduce costs.

1.2  Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

admin client: A component that uses the Storage Services protocols to configure and query the
state of storage entities such as the volume shadow copy, virtual disk, Encrypting File
System (EFS), and removable storage. The Admin Client is also used to configure various
policies that apply to a storage object such as creating or deleting storage volumes, giving
access controls, and getting notifications.

basic disk: A disk on which each volume can be composed of exclusively one partition.

certificate: A certificate is a collection of attributes and extensions that can be stored persistently.
The set of attributes in a certificate can vary depending on the intended usage of the certificate.
A certificate securely binds a public key to the entity that holds the corresponding private key. A
certificate is commonly used for authentication and secure exchange of information on open
networks, such as the Internet, extranets, and intranets. Certificates are digitally signed by the
issuing certification authority (CA) and can be issued for a user, a computer, or a service. The
most widely accepted format for certificates is defined by the ITU-T X.509 version 3
international standards. For more information about attributes and extensions, see [RFC3280]
and [X509] sections 7 and 8.

disk: A persistent storage device that can include physical hard disks, removable disk units, optical

drive units, and logical unit numbers (LUNs) unmasked to the system.

dynamic disk: A disk on which volumes can be composed of more than one partition on disks of

the same pack, as opposed to basic disks where a partition and a volume are equivalent.

Encrypting File System (EFS): The name for the encryption capability of the NTFS file system.
When a file is encrypted using EFS, a symmetric key known as the file encryption key (FEK) is
generated and the contents of the file are encrypted with the FEK. For each user or data
recovery agent (DRA) that is authorized to access the file, a copy of the FEK is encrypted with
that user's or DRA's public key and is stored in the file's metadata. For more information about
EFS, see [MSFT-EFS].

file: An entity of data in the file system that a user can access and manage. A file has to have a
unique name in its directory. It consists of one or more streams of bytes that hold a set of
related data, plus a set of attributes also called properties that describe the file or the data
within the file. The creation time of a file is an example of a file attribute.

file allocation table (FAT): A data structure that the operating system creates when a volume is
formatted by using FAT or FAT32 file systems. The operating system stores information about
each file in the FAT so that it can retrieve the file later.

file system: A system that enables applications to store and retrieve files on storage devices.

Files are placed in a hierarchical structure. The file system specifies naming conventions for files
and the format for specifying the path to a file in the tree structure. Each file system consists of
one or more drivers and DLLs that define the data formats and features of the file system. File
systems can exist on the following storage devices: diskettes, hard disks, jukeboxes, removable
optical disks, and tape backup units.

host bus adapter (HBA): A hardware device that adapts the signals of one electronic interface to

another.

iSCSI initiator: A client of a SCSI interface. An iSCSI initiator issues SCSI commands to request
services from components, which are logical units of a server known as a "target". For more
information, see [RFC3720] section 1.

Library: A storage device that contains one or more tape drives, a number of slots to hold tape

cartridges, and an automated method for loading tapes.

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The primary access protocol for Active

Directory. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an industry-standard protocol,
established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which allows users to query and
update information in a directory service (DS), as described in [MS-ADTS]. The Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol can be either version 2 [RFC1777] or version 3 [RFC3377].

Microsoft Management Console (MMC): Provides a framework that consists of a graphical user
interface (GUI) and a programming platform in which snap-ins (collections of administrative
tools) can be created, opened, and saved. MMC is a multiple-document interface (MDI)
application.

NT file system (NTFS): A proprietary Microsoft file system. For more information, see [MSFT-

NTFS].

partition: In the context of hard disks, a logical region of a hard disk. A hard disk can be

subdivided into one or more partitions.

public key: One of a pair of keys used in public-key cryptography. The public key is distributed
freely and published as part of a digital certificate. For an introduction to this concept, see
[CRYPTO] section 1.8 and [IEEE1363] section 3.1.

redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID): A set of disk-organization techniques that is

designed to achieve high-performance storage access and availability.

remote procedure call (RPC): A communication protocol used primarily between client and

server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime
environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set
of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the
single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message).  For more information, see [C706].

removable media: Any type of storage that is not permanently attached to the computer. A
persistent storage device stores its data on media. If the media can be removed from the
device, the media is considered removable. For example, a floppy disk drive uses removable
media.

shadow copy: A duplicate of data held on a volume at a well-defined instant in time.

shadow copy storage association: The relationship between the original volume and the

volume where the shadow copy storage is located.

storage server: A server that hosts hard disks, removable media, and files.

volume: A group of one or more partitions that forms a logical region of storage and the basis for
a file system. A volume is an area on a storage device that is managed by the file system as a
discrete logical storage unit. A partition contains at least one volume, and a volume can exist
on one or more partitions.

2  Functional Architecture

This section provides an overview of the capabilities of the Storage Services protocols, their
relationships, and a summary of the Storage Services protocols, system dependencies, use cases,
versioning, capability negotiation, error handling, coherency requirements, and security
considerations.

2.1  Overview

The Storage Services protocols provide disk and volume management services, data backup and
restore, removable media management, encrypted file access control, and file encryption.

The Storage Services protocols have four main components:

  A Disk Management service that provides disk and volume management services.

  A Shadow Copy service that backs up and restores data for volumes and file shares.

  A Removable Storage Media Management service (RSMP service) that manages removable storage

media.

  An Encrypting File System service (EFS service) that encrypts and decrypts files.

The following diagram shows the relationship of the main components of the Storage Services
protocols with external components.

Figure 1: Relationships of Storage Services protocols with external components

The main external components that interact with the Storage Services protocols are as follows:

 Admin Tool: A Microsoft Management Console (MMC), which is used by the administrator to
configure the storage on the server.

 Hard disk: A peripheral device that provides persistent data storage and does not have removable
media.

 Volumes: A group of one or more partitions that form a logical region of storage and the basis for a
file system. A volume is an area on a storage device that is managed by the file system as a discrete
logical storage unit. A partition contains at least one volume, and a volume can exist on one or more
partitions.

 Removable device: Any type of storage that is not permanently attached to a computer. A
persistent storage device stores its data on media. If the media can be removed from the device, the
media is considered removable. For example, a floppy disk drive uses removable media.

 Files: An entity of data in the file system that a user can access and manage. A file has a unique
name in its directory. It consists of one or more streams of bytes that hold a set of related data and a

set of attributes, also called properties, which describe the file or the data within the file. The creation
time of a file is an example of a file attribute.

The dotted line in the diagram "Relationships of Storage Services protocols with external components"
indicates local communication between the external components, such as the hard disk, the Admin
Tool, the volumes, the removable device, and the files, and the Storage Services protocols. This local
communication is implementation-specific.

2.1.1  System Capabilities

The Storage Services protocols enable the administrator to store and access data reliably, recover
stored data, and manage the data on the servers. The overall functionality of the Storage Services
protocols includes the following:









 Managing disks and volumes (section 2.1.1.1)

 Backing up and restoring data (section 2.1.1.2)

 Managing removable media (section 2.1.1.3)

 Providing file encryption and access control (section 2.1.1.4)

2.1.1.1  Managing Disks and Volumes

The Storage Services protocols provide an interface for managing disks and volumes and provide an
end-to-end solution for managing storage hardware and disks and for creating volumes on those
disks. This functionality is provided by the Disk Management Remote (DMRP) Protocol, as described in
[MS-DMRP],<2> and the Virtual Disk Service (VDS) Protocol, as described in [MS-VDS].<3>

2.1.1.2  Backing Up and Restoring Data

The Shadow Copy Management Protocol, as described in [MS-SCMP], the File Server Remote VSS
Protocol, as described in [MS-FSRVP], and the Encrypting File System Remote (EFSRPC) Protocol, as
described in [MS-EFSR], aid in backup and restore functionality.

The Shadow Copy Management Protocol is applicable when an application is required to configure
shadow copies and shadow copy storage on the server remotely, which in turn is used by any
snapshot provider to perform data backup-and-restore operations.

The Shadow Copy Management Protocol provides a mechanism for remote configuration of shadow
copies to implement the following functionalities:



Enumerate the volumes on the server that can be shadow copied or used as shadow copy storage.



Enumerate the shadow copies that are available on the server and that are snapshot copies of
a specified original volume.

  Create, modify, enumerate, and delete the shadow copy storage association objects, as

described in [MS-SCMP], that define the location and size of shadow copy storage for specific
original volumes.

  Query all the shadow copy storage association objects on the server that provide shadow copy

storage for a specified original volume and that are located on a specified shadow copy
storage volume.

The File Server Remote VSS Protocol enables an application to query, create, or delete shadow copies
on a file server. After the shadow copy of the file share is created, a VSS-aware application can use
the shadow copy share to back up the application state and data from network shares that are hosted
on a file server. This protocol can be integrated with existing volume shadow copy creation utilities.

The EFSR protocol is used for backup-and-restore operations of encrypted files when application
consistency is not required. For these operations to succeed, the file cannot have an open handle
while it is being backed up; otherwise, the backup-and-restore operations fail. For more information
about backup-and-restore operations for encrypted files, see [MS-EFSR] section 4.

2.1.1.3  Managing Removable Media

Managing removable media is a technology that enables multiple applications to share local
libraries and tape or disk drives. It is used to configure and track the removable storage media, such
as tapes and optical disks, and manage the hardware libraries that contain them, by using changers
and tape libraries, also called tape jukeboxes.

Removable media management is used to manage standalone storage devices, to manage online
media libraries and robotic changers, and to track removable tapes and disks. Standalone devices
include CD-ROM, DVD, and tape drives, such as 4 mm, 8 mm, and Digital Linear Tape (DLT) tape
drives. This functionality is provided by the Removable Storage Manager Remote Protocol, as
described in [MS-RSMP].

2.1.1.4  Providing File Encryption and Access Control

The encryption functionality provides an additional level of security for files and directories. It provides
cryptographic protection of individual files on NTFS file system volumes that use a public key
system.

The Encrypting File System (EFS) checks only whether a file or a directory is marked for encryption
and, if so, it protects the file with the certificate of the user who is adding the file.

Typically, the control for access to file and directory objects, which is provided by the Windows
security model, is sufficient to protect unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, if a
computer that contains sensitive data is lost or stolen, the security protection of that data can be
compromised. Additional access control functionality can be provided by the Encrypting File System
and is accessed remotely through the Encrypting File System Remote Protocol, as described in [MS-
EFSR].

2.1.2  Protocol Relationship

The following diagram shows the relationship among the Storage Services protocols.

Figure 3: Relationship between the Storage Services protocols

The EFSR Protocol uses the interfaces, described in [MS-WCCE], for certificate enrollment, which in
turn uses DCOM, as described in [MS-DCOM], as the transport. For all other operations, EFSR directly
uses the remote procedure call (RPC) extensions, as described in [MS-RPCE].

The DMRP, VDS, and RSMP Protocols use DCOM as the transport.

The SCMP Protocol uses the interfaces, described in [MS-OAUT], which in turn uses DCOM as the
transport.

2.5.1.1  Create and Modify a Volume

Goal

Create and modify volumes.

Context of Use

The administrator is setting up a storage server. For this process, the administrator is required to
create and modify volumes.

Actors

  Admin Tool: A Microsoft Management Console (MMC) component, which is used by the

administrator to configure the storage on the server.

  Admin Client: The primary actor. The Admin Client is code that is running on the

administrator's computer. The Admin Client implements client-side protocol components and
consumes the storage services that are offered by the storage server. The Admin Client's interest
is to correctly interpret, execute, and display the results of the commands that are issued by the

  Administrator: The administrator is the person who administers the storage. The administrator is
interested in organizing the storage, setting access rights, and enforcing quota-based limits on the
storage. The administrator is external to the Storage Services protocols and interacts with the
Storage Services protocols through the Admin Client.

Preconditions

The administrator has configured the Disk Management service in the storage server and has the
appropriate access privileges to configure the disks and volumes.

Main success scenario

1.  Trigger: The administrator requests to create a volume with a specified drive letter by using the

Admin Tool.

2.  The Admin Tool requests that the Admin Client establish a communication channel to the Disk

Management service of the Storage Services protocols.

3.  The Admin Client contacts the Disk Management service by using the

IVolumeClient::CreateVolumeAssignAndFormat method, as described in [MS-DMRP] section
3.2.4.4.1.27, to create a dynamic volume and assign a drive letter.

4.  The Disk Management service creates the requested dynamic volume with the specified drive

letter to store configuration information in an implementation-specific manner.

5.  The administrator requests to increase the size of the volume by using the Admin Tool.

6.  The Admin Client uses the Disk Management service by using the IVolumeClient::GrowVolume
method, as described in [MS-DMRP] section 3.2.4.4.1.30, to increase the size of the volume.

7.  The Disk Management service increases the size of the requested volume.

Postcondition

The required actions have finished successfully: the volume is created, a drive letter is assigned, and
the size of the volume has been increased.

Extensions

If the communication channel for the Disk Management Remote Protocol cannot be established or it
becomes disconnected, the Admin Client attempts to establish the connection multiple times, until it
fails. Whether the volume creation is finished or not depends on when the connection failed.

Variation

A variation of this use case is to create and modify a volume by using the Virtual Disk Service
Protocol. The main success scenario steps of the variation are identical to those in the main use case
that are described in this section.

2.5.1.2  Convert a Basic Disk to a Dynamic Disk

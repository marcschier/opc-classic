1 Introduction
This document provides an overview of language code identifiers (LCIDs), also known as culture
identifiers, which are being deprecated, and the preferred alternate system of locale codes, which
specify a set of locale identifiers that designate culture-specific information such as how text is sorted,
how a date is formatted, and the display format for numbers and currency.
Sections 1.7 and 2 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in this
specification are informative.
1.1 Glossary
This document uses the following terms:
alternate sort: Specifies an alternate collation for a language that has multiple methods for
sorting data. For example, German has both "Dictionary" and "Phone Book" sorts. "Dictionary"
sorting (de-DE) is the default for German, but developers can specify the alternate "Phone
Book" sort (de-DE_phoneb) explicitly.
Chinese BIG5 order: Ideographs are ordered according to the code point values of the Taiwanese
BIG5 industrial standard.
Chinese radical/stroke order: Ideographs are ordered according to radical stroke count.
Chinese Unicode order: Deprecated. Identical to the default sort information used for English.
Georgian modern order: An order for the Georgian language that places archaic characters that
are no longer used at the end of the alphabet.
Georgian traditional order: An order for the Georgian language that intersperses archaic
characters that are no longer used among the rest of the alphabet in their traditional places.
German phone book order: An order that equates Ä, Ö, and Ü with AE, OE, and UE, respectively
(commonly used in German phone books).
Hungarian default order: The typical expected alphabetical order for the Hungarian language.
Hungarian technical order: A sort order that places capital letters before lowercase ones, unlike
most sorts, which sort lowercase first.
Japanese radical/stroke sort order: Ideographs are ordered by their radical and stroke
components, much like an ideographic dictionary might do.
Japanese Unicode order: Deprecated. Identical to the default sort information used for English,
except that the backslash (\) is equal to the currency symbol, 0x00A5, the yen sign.
Japanese XJIS order: Ideographs are ordered according to the code point values of the [JIS X
208] and [JIS X 212] government standards.
Korean KSC order: Ideographs are ordered according to the Korean Hangul pronunciation, as
specified in the Korean [KSC5601] government standard.
Korean Unicode order: Deprecated. Identical to the default sort information used for English,
except that the backslash (\) is equal to the currency symbol, 0x20A9, the won sign.
neutral locale: A locale describing a language without any region-specific information.
PRC Chinese phonetic order: Ideographs are ordered according to their A to Z pronunciation
order.

PRC Chinese stroke count order: Ideographs are ordered according to their stroke count.
specific locale: A locale describing a language that has a qualifying regional variant. For example,
variants for English can be en-US or en-GB.
Traditional Chinese Bopomofo order: Ideographs are ordered by their most common Mandarin
pronunciation, using the Chinese Bopomofo order of the pronunciations.
MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.
1.2 References
Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the
most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents
in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not
match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the Errata.
1.2.1 Normative References

1.3 Overview
The LCID structure is used to identify specific languages for the purpose of customizing software for
particular languages and cultures. For example, it can specify the way dates, times, and numbers are
formatted as strings. It can also specify paper sizes and preferred sort order based on language
elements.

LCIDs are being deprecated, and implementers are strongly encouraged to use locale names instead.
LCIDs can be used for backward compatibility, but as noted in section 2.2.1, there is no guarantee of
LCID uniqueness when used with valid locale names not otherwise associated with an LCID.
1.4 Relationship to Protocols and Other Structures
This structure is related to protocols and structures that need to make special cases for specific
languages and cultures.
1.5 Applicability Statement
This structure applies in scenarios where special cases need to be made for specific languages and
cultures.
1.6 Versioning and Localization
This structure serves to identify particular languages, locales, and cultures.
1.7 Vendor-Extensible Fields
None.

2  Structures
2.1  Language Code Identifiers
LCIDs are identifiers used to specify localizable information. They are also known as culture identifiers
in the Microsoft .NET Framework environment.
The name of a culture consists of its [ISO-639] language code, its [ISO-3166] country/region code,
and an optional [ISO-15924] script tag for the written language. For example, the name of the culture
in which the language is Bosnian (as written in Latin script and used in the Bosnia and Herzegovina
region) is bs-Latn-BA.<1><2><3>
2.2  LCID Structure
This protocol references commonly used data types as defined in [MS-DTYP].
An LCID is a 4-byte value. The value supplied in an LCID is a standard numeric substitution for the
international [RFC5646] string.
The following diagram is shown in host byte order.
|     | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1
| Reserved  | Sort ID  | Language ID  |     |
| --------- | -------- | ------------ | --- |
Reserved (12 bits): This field is reserved for future use. It MUST be 0.
Sort ID (4 bits): The sort order. In most cases, this value can be 0x0, which indicates a default sort
(SORT_DEFAULT). However, other values can be used when an alternate sort is required. These
alternate values are listed in the following table. For example, 0x0407 (German - Germany)
becomes 0x10407 when SORT_GERMAN_PHONE_BOOK is used.

2.2.1 Locale Names without LCIDs
Every locale name without an assigned LCID MAY be temporarily given one of the LCIDs in the
following table, if the application requests an LCID.<14> These locale names include any valid
[RFC5646] language tag.
Note: LCID assignments for Locale Names without LCIDs are temporary and are not suitable
for use across a protocol, or for interchange between processes or machines. These temporary
LCID assignments are also unsuitable for tagging persisted data as the meaning of the LCID
assignment will change over time.
Name Value Conditions
LOCALE_CUSTOM_USER_DEFAULT<15> 0x0C00 When an LCID without a permanent LCID
assignment is also the current user locale, the
protocol will respond with
LOCALE_CUSTOM_USER_DEFAULT for that locale.
This assignment persists until the user changes the
locale. Because the meaning changes over time,
applications are discouraged from persisting this
data. Though this value will likely refer to the same
locale for the lifetime of the current process, that is
not guaranteed. This assignment is a 1-to-1
relationship between this LCID and the user’s
current default locale name.

| Name  | Value  | Conditions  |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
Transient LCIDs<16>  0x2000,  Some user configurations temporarily associate a
|     | 0x2400,         | locale without a permanent LCID assignment with           |
| --- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|     | 0x2800,         | one of these 12 transient LCIDs. This assignment is       |
|     | 0x2C00,         | transient and it is not guaranteed; it will likely refer  |
|     | 0x3000,         | to the same locale for the lifetime of the process.       |
|     | 0x3400,         | However, this assignment will differ for other users      |
|     | 0x3800,         | on the machine, or other machines, and, as such,          |
|     | 0x3C00,         | is unsuitable for use in protocols or persisted data.     |
|     | 0x4000,         | This assignment is a temporary 1-to-1 relationship        |
|     | 0x4400,         | between an LCID and a particular locale name and          |
|     | 0x4800, 0x4C00  | will round trip until that relationship changes.          |
LOCALE_CUSTOM_UNSPECIFIED<17>   0x1000  When an LCID is requested for a locale without a
permanent LCID assignment, nor a temporary
assignment as above, the protocol will respond
with LOCALE_CUSTOM_UNSPECIFIED for all such
locales. Because this single value is used for
numerous possible locale names, it is impossible to
round trip this locale, even temporarily.
Applications should discard this value as soon as
possible and never persist it. If the system is
forced to respond to a request for
LCID_CUSTOM_UNSPECIFIED, it will fall back to
the current user locale. This is often incorrect but
may prevent an application or component from
failing. As the meaning of this temporary LCID is
unstable, it should never be used for interchange
or persisted data. This is a 1-to-many relationship
that is very unstable.

5 Appendix A: Product Behavior
The information in this specification is applicable to the following Microsoft products or supplemental
software. References to product versions include updates to those products.
The terms "earlier" and "later", when used with a product version, refer to either all preceding
versions or all subsequent versions, respectively. The term "through" refers to the inclusive range of
versions. Applicable Microsoft products are listed chronologically in this section.
Windows Client
 Windows NT operating system
 Windows 2000 operating system
 Windows XP operating system
 Windows Vista operating system
 Windows 7 operating system
 Windows 8 operating system
 Windows 8.1 operating system

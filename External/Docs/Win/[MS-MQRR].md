## 1 Introduction

This document specifies the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol, a
remote procedure call (RPC)-based protocol that is used by Microsoft Message Queuing
(MSMQ) clients to read or reject a message from a queue, to move a message between queues,
and to purge all messages from a queue.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

### 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

authentication level: A numeric value indicating the level of authentication or message protection

that remote procedure call (RPC) will apply to a specific message exchange. For more
information, see [C706] section 13.1.2.1 and [MS-RPCE].

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): A high-precision atomic time standard that approximately
tracks Universal Time (UT). It is the basis for legal, civil time all over the Earth. Time zones
around the world are expressed as positive and negative offsets from UTC. In this role, it is also
referred to as Zulu time (Z) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). In these specifications, all
references to UTC refer to the time at UTC-0 (or GMT).

cursor: A data structure providing sequential access over a message queue. A cursor has a current
pointer that lies between the head and tail pointer of the queue. The pointer can be moved
forward or backward through an operation on the cursor (Next). A message at the current
pointer can be accessed through a nondestructive read (Peek) operation or a destructive read
(Receive) operation.

dead-letter queue: A queue that contains messages that were sent from a host with a request
for negative source journaling and that could not be delivered. Message Queuing provides a
transactional dead-letter queue and a non-transactional dead-letter queue.

direct format name: A name that is used to reference a public queue or a private queue without
accessing the MSMQ Directory Service. Message Queuing can use the physical, explicit location
information provided by direct format names to send messages directly to their destinations.
For more information, see [MS-MQMQ] section 2.1.

directory: The database that stores information about objects such as users, groups, computers,

printers, and the directory service that makes this information available to users and
applications.

dynamic endpoint: A network-specific server address that is requested and assigned at run time.

For more information, see [C706].

endpoint: A network-specific address of a remote procedure call (RPC) server process for remote

procedure calls. The actual name and type of the endpoint depends on the RPC protocol
sequence that is being used. For example, for RPC over TCP (RPC Protocol Sequence
ncacn_ip_tcp), an endpoint might be TCP port 1025. For RPC over Server Message Block (RPC
Protocol Sequence ncacn_np), an endpoint might be the name of a named pipe. For more
information, see [C706].

globally unique identifier (GUID): A term used interchangeably with universally unique

identifier (UUID) in Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of
these terms does not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the value.
Specifically, the use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in

[MS-MQRR] - v20251121

Release: November 21, 2025

8 / 96


[RFC4122] or [C706] have to be used for generating the GUID. See also universally unique
identifier (UUID).

Interface Definition Language (IDL): The International Standards Organization (ISO) standard

language for specifying the interface for remote procedure calls. For more information, see
[C706] section 4.

Kerberos: An authentication system that enables two parties to exchange private information

across an otherwise open network by assigning a unique key (called a ticket) to each user that
logs on to the network and then embedding these tickets into messages sent by the users. For
more information, see [MS-KILE].

message: A data structure representing a unit of data transfer between distributed applications. A
message has message properties, which can include message header properties, a message
body property, and message trailer properties.

message body: A distinguished message property that represents the application payload.

message header: See message packet header.

message packet: A byte buffer that is the physical representation of the message in the queue

manager and on the wire.

message packet header: The set of message properties in a message packet that precedes

the message body property. Also called a message header.

message packet trailer: The set of message properties in a message packet that follows the

message body property. Also called a message trailer.

message property: A data structure that contains a property identifier and a value, and that is

associated with a message.

message queuing: A communications service that provides asynchronous and reliable message
passing between distributed client applications. In message queuing, clients send messages to
message queues and consume messages from message queues. The message queues provide
persistence of the messages, which enables the sending and receiving client applications to
operate asynchronously from each other.

message trailer: See message packet trailer.

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ): A communications service that provides asynchronous

and reliable message passing between distributed applications. In Message Queuing,
applications send messages to queues and consume messages from queues. The queues
provide persistence of the messages, enabling the sending and receiving applications to
operate asynchronously from one another.

MSMQ routing server: A role played by an MSMQ queue manager. An MSMQ routing server

implements store and forward messaging. A routing server can provide connectivity between
different connected networks within a site or can provide session concentration between sites.

Network Data Representation (NDR): A specification that defines a mapping from Interface
Definition Language (IDL) data types onto octet streams. NDR also refers to the runtime
environment that implements the mapping facilities (for example, data provided to NDR). For
more information, see [MS-RPCE] and [C706] section 14.

NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Authentication Protocol: A protocol using a challenge-response

mechanism for authentication in which clients are able to verify their identities without sending a
password to the server. It consists of three messages, commonly referred to as Type 1
(negotiation), Type 2 (challenge) and Type 3 (authentication).

queue: An object that holds messages passed between applications or messages passed

between Message Queuing and applications. In general, applications can send messages to
queues and read messages from queues.

queue manager (QM): A message queuing service that manages queues deployed on a

computer. A queue manager can also provide asynchronous transfer of messages to queues
deployed on other queue managers.

remote procedure call (RPC): A communication protocol used primarily between client and

server. The term has three definitions that are often used interchangeably: a runtime
environment providing for communication facilities between computers (the RPC runtime); a set
of request-and-response message exchanges between computers (the RPC exchange); and the
single message from an RPC exchange (the RPC message).  For more information, see [C706].

remote queue: For a queue manager, a queue that is hosted by a remote queue manager.
For an application, a queue hosted by a queue manager other than the one with which the
application communicates.

RPC protocol sequence: A character string that represents a valid combination of a remote

procedure call (RPC) protocol, a network layer protocol, and a transport layer protocol, as
described in [C706] and [MS-RPCE].

subqueue: A message queue that is logically associated, through a naming hierarchy, with a

parent message queue. Subqueues can be used to partition messages within the queue. For
example, a queue journal can be a subqueue that holds a copy of each message consumed
from its parent queue.

transactional queue: A queue that contains only transactional messages.

Unicode: A character encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents

almost all of the written languages of the world. The Unicode standard [UNICODE5.0.0/2007]
provides three forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32) and seven schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16
BE, UTF-16 LE, UTF-32, UTF-32 LE, and UTF-32 BE).

universally unique identifier (UUID): A 128-bit value. UUIDs can be used for multiple

purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very
persistent objects in cross-process communication such as client and server interfaces, manager
entry-point vectors, and RPC objects. UUIDs are highly likely to be unique. UUIDs are also
known as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) and these terms are used interchangeably in
the Microsoft protocol technical documents (TDs). Interchanging the usage of these terms does
not imply or require a specific algorithm or mechanism to generate the UUID. Specifically, the
use of this term does not imply or require that the algorithms described in [RFC4122] or [C706]
has to be used for generating the UUID.

in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

### 1.3 Overview

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) is a communications service that provides asynchronous and
reliable message passing between client applications running on different hosts. In MSMQ, clients
send application messages to a queue and/or consume application messages from a queue. The
queue provides persistence of the messages, enabling them to survive across application restarts and

11 / 96

Release: November 21, 2025


allowing the sending and receiving client applications to send and receive messages asynchronously
from each other.

Queues are typically hosted by a communications service called a queue manager. By hosting the
queue manager in a separate service from the client applications, applications can communicate even
if they never execute at the same time by exchanging messages via a queue hosted by the queue
manager.

The queue manager can execute on a different node than the client applications. When this scenario
occurs, a protocol is required to insert messages into the queue, and another protocol is needed to
consume messages from the queue. The Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read
Protocol provides a protocol for consuming messages from a remote queue.

#### 1.3.1 Messages

Each message exchanged in an MSMQ system typically has a set of message properties that
contain metadata about the message and a distinguished property called a message body that
contains the application payload. Message properties that are serialized in front of the message body
are referred to as message headers, and message properties serialized after the message body
property are referred to as message trailers.

Messages carried by this protocol are treated as payload. The format and structure of the application
messages are generally opaque to the protocol. However, the protocol assumes that such messages
map to the abstractions of message header, message body, and message trailer. This mapping
enables a consumer to request that a subset of the message body be returned while allowing all the
message headers and message trailers to be returned. For more details, see the
SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6) structure.

The protocol also assumes that each message has a lookup identifier that is unique within the queue.
This identifier is not part of the message but is instead assigned by the server.

#### 1.3.2 Queues

A queue is a logical data structure that contains an ordered list of zero or more messages. Queues,
like files, have names. This protocol uses the QUEUE_FORMAT (section 2.2.3) structure to identify
queues.

This protocol provides a mechanism to open a queue. Opening provides an opportunity to check for
the existence of the queue and to perform authorization checks. The protocol provides for the return
of an RPC context handle that is used by the client to specify the queue to operate on in subsequent
requests. The use of an RPC context handle provides a mechanism to ensure that server state is
cleaned up if the connection between the client and server is lost.

When opening a queue, the client can specify an access mode that determines the operations (Peek,
Receive, Move, Reject, and Purge) for which the returned handle can subsequently be used. The client
can specify a sharing mode that either allows other clients to concurrently access the queue or
ensures that the client has exclusive access to the queue. The latter can be used to avoid race
conditions caused by other clients operating on the queue at the same time.

#### 1.3.3 Queue Operations

The protocol provides mechanisms for the following operations against an open queue.

A message can be consumed from an open queue through a destructive read operation referred to as
a Receive operation, which atomically reads the message and removes it from the queue. Because
this operation removes a message from a queue, a loss of network connection during this operation
could result in permanent loss of the message. To guard against this situation, the protocol provides a
mechanism for the client to positively or negatively acknowledge receipt of the message. Upon receipt

12 / 96

[MS-MQRR] - v20251121
Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol
Copyright © 2025 Microsoft Corporation
Release: November 21, 2025


of positive acknowledgment from the client, the server can remove the message from the queue.
While the server is awaiting acknowledgment from the client, access to the message by other clients is
prevented.

A message can be read from an open queue through a nondestructive read operation referred to as a
Peek operation, which reads the message but does not remove it from the queue.

For both Receive and Peek operations, the client can limit the amount of the message body payload
returned. This functionality enables efficient use of network resources when the client requires only a
portion of the message body or when the client needs just the message properties.

All the messages can be removed from a queue through a Purge mechanism. The messages removed
through this mechanism are not returned to the client.

A message can be moved from one queue to another queue hosted at the same server through an
atomic Move mechanism.

A client can inform the server that it has no need for a message via a Reject operation. The server
can use this indication to inform the sender that the client did not consume the message. How a
server does this task is not addressed in this specification.

#### 1.3.4 Access Patterns

Messages in a queue can be consumed in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) access pattern. Because
messages in a queue are ordered, there is a head that represents the front of the queue and a tail
that represents the end of the queue.

The protocol provides mechanisms to Peek or Receive the first message in the queue.

The protocol also allows the client to specify exactly which message to Peek or Receive, regardless of
its position in the queue, through a unique lookup identifier assigned to each message by the server.
A message can also be specified relative to the message identified by the lookup identifier: for
example, the message immediately preceding or following the message identified by the lookup
identifier.

Finally, the protocol provides a mechanism, referred to as a cursor, for sequential forward access
through the queue. A cursor logically represents a current pointer that lies between the head and tail
of the queue. A cursor can be specified to the Peek or Receive operation, which Peeks or Receives
the message at the current pointer represented by the cursor. The cursor current pointer can be
moved forward through a modified Peek operation called PeekNext. A Receive operation intrinsically
moves the cursor forward.

Because cursors are stateful, the protocol provides mechanisms to create a cursor, to return a cursor
handle to the client, and to close a cursor. Because a cursor represents a position within a queue, the
protocol logically relates the cursor to the context handle associated with an open queue. The protocol
places no limit on the number of concurrent cursors associated with a queue context handle.

#### 1.3.5 Transactions

The protocol allows the queue operations Receive or Move to be performed within the context of a
distributed atomic transaction, as specified in [MS-DTCO]. When this is done, the state changes that
are related to the queue associated with the operation are performed provisionally, awaiting
asynchronous notification of the outcome of the transaction. If the transaction outcome is Commit,
the state changes become permanent. If the transaction outcome is Abort, the state changes are
rolled back.

The protocol does not require that all queues support this atomic transaction behavior. A queue that
supports transactional Receive is also required to support nontransactional Receive. The protocol
returns an error if a transacted operation is attempted against a non-transactional queue. The protocol

[MS-MQRR] - v20251121
Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol

Release: November 21, 2025


does not provide any other mechanism for determining whether a queue supports transactional
behavior.

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

This protocol is dependent upon RPC for its transport, as specified in section 2.1.

The protocol functionality is a superset of the functionality as specified in [MS-MQQP]. Implementers
are advised to choose this protocol over [MS-MQQP] except where compatibility necessitates using
it.<1>

This protocol carries Propagation Tokens ([MS-DTCO] section 2.2.5.4) to orchestrate transactional
scenarios.

This protocol is capable of carrying the layout and internal structure of the message in the queue, as
specified in [MS-MQQP].

### 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol is an RPC interface and, as a
result, has prerequisites, as specified in [MS-RPCE], that are common to RPC interfaces.

It is assumed that the protocol client has obtained the name of a remote computer that supports this
protocol before this protocol is invoked.

This protocol uses authentication through RPC. The client has previously acquired valid credentials
recognized by the server. The server has to be started and fully initialized before the protocol can
start.

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

This protocol provides functionality related to consumption of messages from a queue hosted at a
queue manager running on a remote computer. It does not provide functionality related to inserting
messages into a queue.

The server side of this protocol is applicable for implementation by a queue manager that provides
message queuing communication services to clients. The client side of this protocol is applicable for
implementation by client libraries that provide message queuing services to applications or by a client
queue manager that delegates requests on behalf of a client application.

This protocol could be used to reliably transfer messages from a queue hosted at one queue manager
(the server) to a queue hosted at another queue manager (the client). However, there are other
protocols that are more suited to providing such reliable message transfer between queues. The
Message Queuing (MSMQ): Binary Reliable Messaging protocol described in [MS-MQBR] is one such
protocol that provides message transfer functionality more efficiently and in a manner that provides
end-to-end reliability through intermediate store-and-forward hops.

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

Supported transports: This protocol uses the RPC over TCP/IP protocol sequence. However, it
supports a mechanism for explicitly negotiating the RPC endpoint to be used. Details are specified in
section 3.1.4.1.

Protocol versions: This protocol uses a single version of the RPC interface, but that interface has been
extended by adding the following additional methods at the end:

  R_MoveMessage (Opnum 10) (section 3.1.4.10)

  R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum 11) (section 3.1.4.11)

  R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12) (section 3.1.4.12)

  R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section 3.1.4.13)

  R_SetUserAcknowledgementClass (Opnum 14) (section 3.1.4.14)

  R_EndTransactionalReceive (Opnum 15) (section 3.1.4.15)

Capability Negotiation: This protocol is used for receiving messages from a remote queue
manager.<2> The queue manager can implement a capability negotiation mechanism as specified in
the processing rules for Opening a Queue (section 3.2.4.1) to determine whether this protocol is
supported by the remote queue manager.

Security and authentication methods: This protocol supports the NT LAN Manager (NTLM)
Authentication Protocol and Kerberos authentication methods.<3>

### 1.8 Vendor-Extensible Fields

This protocol uses HRESULT values as defined in [MS-ERREF] section 2.1. Vendors can define their
own HRESULT values provided that they set the C bit (0x20000000) for each vendor-defined value,
indicating that the value is a customer code.

### 2.1 Transport

This protocol MUST use the following RPC protocol sequence: RPC over TCP/IP (ncacn_ip_tcp), as
specified in [MS-RPCE]. This protocol uses RPC dynamic endpoints as specified in [C706] section 4.
This protocol MAY<4> use an RPC static endpoint as specified in [C706] section 4.

This protocol allows any user to establish a connection to the RPC server. For each connection, the
server uses the underlying RPC protocol to retrieve the identity of the invoking client, as specified in
[MS-RPCE] section 3.3.3.4.3. The server SHOULD use this identity to perform method-specific access
checks.

### 2.2 Common Data Types

This protocol references commonly used data types as defined in [MS-DTYP].

This protocol MUST indicate to the RPC runtime that it is to support both the Network Data
Representation (NDR) and NDR64 transfer syntaxes and MUST provide a negotiation mechanism for
determining which transfer syntax will be used, as specified in [MS-RPCE] (section 3).

In addition to the RPC base types and definitions, as specified in [C706] and [MS-RPCE], this
specification supports the following data types:

  HRESULT

  GUID

  QUEUE_FORMAT ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.7)

  Queue Context Handles (section 2.2.4)

  Message Packet Structure (section 2.2.5)

  SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6)

  SectionType (section 2.2.7)

#### 2.2.1 HRESULT

This specification uses the HRESULT ([MS-ERREF] section 2.1) type.

#### 2.2.2 GUID

This specification uses a globally unique identifier (GUID). Unless otherwise qualified, instances of
GUID in sections 2 and 3 refer to [MS-DTYP] section 2.3.4.

#### 2.2.3 QUEUE_FORMAT

This structure is used to identify a queue. This structure is common to many Microsoft Message
Queuing (MSMQ) protocols. For more details, see [MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.7. Only a subset of the
QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.6) enumeration is supported by this protocol. This
subset is:

  QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_UNKNOWN

  QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_PUBLIC

  QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_PRIVATE

  QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_DIRECT

  QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_MACHINE

  QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_SUBQUEUE

In addition, this protocol supports only a subset of the Protocol Address Specifications defined for
QUEUE_FORMAT in [MS-MQMQ] section 2.1.2 when the m_qft member of this structure is set to
QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_DIRECT. This subset is:



TCP

  OS

#### 2.2.4 Queue Context Handles

A queue context handle is an RPC context handle corresponding to an open queue. A client MUST call
the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section 3.1.4.2) method or the R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum
11) (section 3.1.4.11) method to create a queue context handle and the R_CloseQueue (Opnum
3) (section 3.1.4.3) method to delete a queue context handle.

Two IDL types are defined to represent these queue context handles, namely
QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1) and
QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.2). These two types are identical on the wire,
but are defined separately so as to allow the serialization mode to be configured. Refer to [MSDN-
MMSCH] for details on modes of the context handles.

##### 2.2.4.1 QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE is an RPC context handle representing an open queue.
Refer to [MSDN-MMSCH] for details on modes of the context handles. For the
QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE context handle, there can be more than one pending RPC
call on the server. On the wire it is identical to
QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.2).

This type is declared as follows:

 typedef [context_handle] void* QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE;

The context handle MUST NOT be type_strict, but it MUST be strict. More details on RPC context
handles are specified in [C706] sections 4.2.16.6, 5.1.6, and 6.1 and [MS-RPCE] sections
3.1.1.5.3.2.2.2 and 3.3.1.4.1.

##### 2.2.4.2 QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE is an RPC context handle representing an open queue. Refer
to [MSDN-MMSCH] for details on modes of the context handles. For this context handle, there can be
no more than one pending RPC call on the server. On the wire it is identical to
QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1).

This type is declared as follows:

 typedef [context_handle] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE;

The context handle MUST NOT be type_strict, but it MUST be strict. More details on RPC context
handles are specified in [C706] sections 4.2.16.6, 5.1.6, and 6.1 and [MS-RPCE] sections
3.1.1.5.3.2.2.2 and 3.3.1.4.1.

#### 2.2.5 Message Packet Structure

The Message Packet Structure is the data structure that contains the UserMessage and other
headers that represent the payload that is transferred across the wire as a result of a remote read
operation. More details are specified in R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section 3.1.4.7) and
R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section 3.1.4.13).

#### 2.2.6 SectionBuffer

A SectionBuffer represents a fragment or section of a Message Packet (section 2.2.5). Operations
R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section 3.1.4.7) and R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum
13) (section 3.1.4.13) fragment a Message Packet into an array of one or more SectionBuffer
structures. The client concatenates these fragments to reconstruct a valid Message Packet. There
can be up to two sections per message. A Message Packet is split into two sections only when a
subset of the distinguished message body property is returned. The first section always contains the
message body property up to the size requested.

 typedef struct _SectionBuffer {
   SectionType SectionBufferType;
   DWORD SectionSizeAlloc;
   DWORD SectionSize;
   [unique, size_is(SectionSize)] byte* pSectionBuffer;
 } SectionBuffer;

SectionBufferType:  MUST specify a type for the SectionBuffer structure that indicates whether the

pSectionBuffer member contains the whole Message Packet or MUST indicate which section is
contained. The SectionType (section 2.2.7) enumeration lists possible values. More details are
specified in 2.2.7.

SectionSizeAlloc:  MUST specify the original size (in bytes) of the part of the Message Packet that

this SectionBuffer represents. When the SectionBuffer represents the first section of the
message, this field specifies the size that the SectionBuffer would have been if the entire
message body property were included. The difference between the values of the
SectionSizeAlloc member and the SectionSize member represents the size of the message
body that was not transferred.

If the SectionBufferType member value is stFullPacket, stBinarySecondSection, or
stSrmpSecondSection, then the SectionSizeAlloc member value MUST be equal to the
SectionSize member value.

If the SectionBufferType member value is stBinaryFirstSection or stSrmpFirstSection, then the
SectionSizeAlloc member value MUST be equal to or greater than the SectionSize member
value.

SectionSize:  MUST be the size (in bytes) of the buffer pointed to by the pSectionBuffer member.
The SectionSize member specifies the size of the part of the Message Packet contained in the
pSectionBuffer member.

pSectionBuffer:  MUST be a pointer to an array of bytes containing a section of the Message

Packet.

#### 2.2.7 SectionType

The SectionType enumeration defines the available SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6) types.

 typedef  enum
 {
   stFullPacket = 0,
   stBinaryFirstSection = 1,
   stBinarySecondSection = 2,
   stSrmpFirstSection = 3,
   stSrmpSecondSection = 4
 } SectionType;

stFullPacket:  The pSectionBuffer member of the SectionBuffer structure contains a complete
Message Packet Structure (section 2.2.5). The UserMessage (section 2.2.5.1) is either that
specified in section 2.2.5.1.1 or in section 2.2.5.1.2.

stBinaryFirstSection:  The pSectionBuffer member of the SectionBuffer structure contains the

first section of the Binary Message (section 2.2.5.1.1) packet up to, but not beyond, the
MessagePropertiesHeader ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.19.3) in the UserMessage.

stBinarySecondSection:  The pSectionBuffer member of the SectionBuffer structure contains the

second section of the Binary Message packet from beyond the end of the
MessagePropertiesHeader in the UserMessage to the end of the packet.

stSrmpFirstSection:  The pSectionBuffer member of the SectionBuffer structure contains the first

section of the SRMP Message packet up to, but not beyond, the
CompoundMessageHeader (section 2.2.5.1.2.2) in the UserMessage.

stSrmpSecondSection:  The pSectionBuffer member of the SectionBuffer structure contains the

second section of the SRMP Message packet from beyond the end of the
CompoundMessageHeader in the UserMessage to the end of the packet.

#### 2.2.8 XACTUOW

The XACTUOW ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.18.1.8) structure uniquely identifies the unit of work (UOW)
for a transactional operation. For an external transaction, this value MUST be acquired from the
transaction coordinator. For an internal transaction, a client MUST create a unique random value for
each transaction.<9>

### 2.3 Directory Service Schema Elements

This protocol uses ADM elements specified in section 3.1.1. A subset of these elements can be
published in a directory. This protocol accesses the directory using the algorithm specified in [MS-
MQDSSM] and using LDAP [MS-ADTS]. The Directory Service schema elements for ADM elements
published in the directory are defined in [MS-MQDSSM] section 2.4.

## 3 Protocol Details

### 3.1 RemoteRead Server Details

#### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

This section describes a conceptual model of possible data organization that an implementation
maintains to participate in this protocol. The described organization is provided to facilitate the
explanation of how the protocol behaves. This document does not mandate that implementations
adhere to this model as long as their external behavior is consistent with that described in this
document.

 The abstract data model for this protocol comprises elements that are private to this protocol and
others that are shared between multiple MSMQ protocols that are co-located at a common queue
manager. The shared abstract data model is defined in [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1, and the
relationship between this protocol, a queue manager, and other protocols that share a common queue
manager is described in [MS-MQOD].

 Section 3.1.1.1 specifies the abstract data model (ADM) elements from the shared data model that
are manipulated by this protocol, and sections 3.1.1.2 through 3.1.1.4 specify the ADM elements that
are private to this protocol.

##### 3.1.1.1 Shared Data Elements

This protocol manipulates the following ADM elements from the shared abstract data model.

Cursor: [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.2.

Message: [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.12.

MessagePosition: [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.11

OpenQueueDescriptor: [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.16.

OpenQueueDescriptorCollection: [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.2.

Queue: [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.2.

QueueManager: [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.1.

Transaction: [MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.14.

##### 3.1.1.2 PendingRequestEntry

The PendingRequestEntry ADM element encapsulates a pending request to peek or receive a
message from an open queue and specifies the following ADM attributes:

RequestId: The request ID supplied by the client.

LookupIdentifier: The LookupIdentifier ADM attribute of a Message ([MS-MQDMPR] section

3.1.1.12) ADM element instance associated with the request.

QueueContextHandle: An RPC context handle corresponding to an open queue, as defined by

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1).

TimeStamp: A 32-bit unsigned integer that represents the time, in milliseconds, at which the

client request was received.

##### 3.1.1.3 PendingRequestTable

The PendingRequestTable ADM element represents a hash table that contains references to
PendingRequestEntry (section 3.1.1.2) ADM element instances keyed on
{PendingRequestEntry.RequestId, PendingRequestEntry.QueueContextHandle}.

##### 3.1.1.4 Message

The local Message ADM element extends the base Message ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.10) ADM
element.

The server MUST maintain private state for each local Message ADM element instance in addition to
the state specified by the Message ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.1.10) ADM element. The following
additional ADM attributes are specified to reference this private state:

Type: The type of the message packet, either binary or SRMP.

Offset: The offset and byte size of the message headers, message body, and message

trailers.

#### 3.1.2 Timers

The Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read protocol MUST maintain the following
timers:

  RPC Call Timeout Timer (section 3.1.2.1)



Pending Request Cleanup Timer (section 3.1.2.2)

##### 3.1.2.1 RPC Call Timeout Timer

This protocol uses nondefault behavior for the RPC Call Timeout Timer, as specified in [MS-RPCE]
section 3.3.2.2.2. This protocol uses a timer value of 300,000 milliseconds<10>, which applies to the
following method calls:

  R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section 3.1.4.2)

  R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum 11) (section 3.1.4.11)

  R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12) (section 3.1.4.12)

The server MUST maintain a per-call timer for each call to the R_StartReceive (Opnum
7) (section 3.1.4.7) method or the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section 3.1.4.13)
method in which the dwTimeout parameter is nonzero. The timer MUST be set to the dwTimeout
parameter that is specified on the call.

##### 3.1.2.2 Pending Request Cleanup Timer

This timer regulates the amount of time that the protocol waits before removing expired entries from
the PendingRequestTable (section 3.1.1.3) ADM element. The server MUST maintain a per-call timer
for each call to the R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section 3.1.4.7) method or the
R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section 3.1.4.13) method. This timer is set when a
PendingRequestEntry (section 3.1.1.2) ADM element instance is added to the PendingRequestTable
ADM element. The duration of this timer MUST be set based on the system configuration, which is
implementation-dependent.<11>

pClientId: MUST be set by the client to a pointer to a valid GUID that uniquely identifies the client.

When the queue manager acts as the client, the queue manager sets this value to the
Identifier ADM attribute of the local QueueManager ADM element instance. The server SHOULD
ignore this parameter. The server MAY<14> use this parameter to impose a limit on the number
of unique callers. NULL is invalid for this parameter.

fNonRoutingServer: If the client is configured to operate in the role of an MSMQ routing server,

this parameter MUST be set to FALSE (0x00000000); otherwise, it MUST be set to TRUE
(0x00000001).<15> If the value of the fNonRoutingServer parameter is FALSE (0x00000000), the
server MUST ignore the pClientId parameter.

  Return STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED (0xC0000022).

##### 3.1.4.7 R_StartReceive (Opnum 7)

The R_StartReceive method peeks or receives a message from an open queue.

If the R_StartReceive method is invoked with a Peek action type, as specified in the ulAction
parameter, the operation completes when the R_StartReceive method returns.

If the R_StartReceive method is invoked with a Receive action type, as specified in the ulAction
parameter, the client MUST pair each call to the R_StartReceive method with a call to the
R_EndReceive (Opnum 9) (section 3.1.4.9) method to complete the operation, or to the
R_CancelReceive (Opnum 8) (section 3.1.4.8) method to cancel the operation. The call to the
R_EndReceive method or the R_CancelReceive method is correlated to a call to the
R_StartReceive method through matching dwRequestId parameters.

If the client specifies a nonzero ulTimeout parameter, and a message is not available in the queue at
the time of the call, the server waits up to the specified time-out for a message to become available in
the queue before responding to the call. The client can call the R_CancelReceive method with a
matching dwRequestId parameter to cancel the pending R_StartReceive method request.

The message to be returned can be specified in one of three ways:



LookupId: A nonzero LookupId parameter value specifies the unique identifier for the message to
be returned. The ulAction parameter further specifies whether the message to be returned is the

one identified by the LookupId parameter or the first unlocked message immediately preceding or
following it. For more details, see the description of the ulAction parameter.

  Cursor: A nonzero cursor handle specifies the cursor to be used to identify the message to be
returned. The cursor specifies a location in the queue. The ulAction parameter further specifies
whether the message to be returned is the one identified by the cursor or the first unlocked
message immediately following it. For more details, see the description of the ulAction parameter.



First: if the LookupId parameter is set to zero and the hCursor parameter is set to zero, the first
unlocked message in the queue can be returned. The ulAction parameter further specifies whether
the first message is to be received or peeked.

The ppPacketSections parameter is the address of one or more pointers to one or more
SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6) structures. The pSectionBuffer member of the first SectionBuffer
structure points to the beginning of the message packet. If more than one SectionBuffer structure
is present, the packet sections are concatenated in the order in which they appear in the array to form
the entire packet. The size of each section is stored in the SectionSizeAlloc member of the
SectionBuffer structure.

 HRESULT R_StartReceive(

 );

hBind: MUST specify an RPC binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.

phContext: MUST be set by the client to a

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1) handle of the queue from which to
read a message. The handle MUST have been returned by the server in the pphQueue output
parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section 3.1.4.2) method and MUST NOT
have been closed through a call prior to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section 3.1.4.3) method.
This value MUST NOT be NULL.

The handle MUST have been opened with a dwAccess parameter value that permits the operation
specified by the ulAction parameter. For more details, see the dwAccess parameter in the
R_OpenQueue method.

LookupId: If nonzero, specifies the lookup identifier of the message to be acted on.

If the client sets the LookupId parameter to a nonzero value, the valid values for other parameters
are as follows:







ulTimeout set to 0x00000000.

hCursor set to 0x00000000.

ulAction set to one of the following:

If the client sets the LookupId parameter to 0x0000000000000000, all of the preceding values
of the ulAction parameter are invalid.

hCursor: If nonzero, specifies a handle to a cursor that MUST have been obtained from a prior call to
the R_CreateCursor (Opnum 4) (section 3.1.4.4) method. The handle MUST NOT have been closed
through a prior call to the R_CloseCursor (Opnum 5) (section 3.1.4.5) method.

If the client sets the hCursor parameter to a nonzero value, the valid values for other parameters
are as follows:





LookupId set to 0x0000000000000000

ulAction set to one of the following:

queue. The valid value for this parameter is 0x00000000 if the LookupId parameter value is
nonzero or if the action is not MQ_ACTION_RECEIVE, MQ_ACTION_PEEK_CURRENT, or
MQ_ACTION_PEEK_NEXT.

dwRequestId: MUST be set by the client to a unique correlation identifier for the receive request.

This value MUST be used in a subsequent call to the R_EndReceive method or the
R_CancelReceive method to correlate that call with the call to the R_StartReceive method. The
value MUST NOT be used in another R_StartReceive method call on the same
QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE handle until a call to either the R_EndReceive
method or the R_CancelReceive method with the same dwRequestId parameter value has been
completed.

##### 3.1.4.8 R_CancelReceive (Opnum 8)

The R_CancelReceive method cancels a pending call to the R_StartReceive (Opnum
7) (section 3.1.4.7) method or the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section 3.1.4.13)
method. Each of those methods takes a time-out parameter that can cause the server to not return a
response until a message becomes available or the time-out expires. The R_CancelReceive method
provides a way for the client to cancel a blocked request.

 HRESULT R_CancelReceive(
   [in] handle_t hBind,
   [in] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE phContext,
   [in] DWORD dwRequestId
 );

Release: November 21, 2025

46 / 96


hBind: MUST be an RPC binding handle parameter as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.

phContext: MUST be set by the client to the

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1) handle used in the corresponding call
to the R_StartReceive method that is to be canceled. The handle MUST have been returned by
the server in the pphQueue output parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum
2) (section 3.1.4.2) method and MUST NOT have been previously closed through a call to the
R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section 3.1.4.3) method. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

dwRequestId: MUST be set by the client to the same value as the dwRequestId parameter in the
corresponding call to the R_StartReceive method or the R_StartTransactionalReceive
method. This parameter acts as an identifier to correlate an R_CancelReceive method call to an
R_StartReceive or an R_StartTransactionalReceive method call.

Return Values: On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure HRESULT, and the client MUST treat all failure
HRESULTs identically.

Exceptions Thrown:

No exceptions are thrown except those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol, as specified in [MS-
RPCE].

When processing this call, the server MUST:





Find the corresponding OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element instance by comparing the
phContext parameter with the Handle ADM attribute for all OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element
instances maintained by the local QueueManager ADM element instance.

If not found, return a failure HRESULT, and perform no further actions; otherwise, assign the
found OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element instance to the local variable queueDesc.

  Generate a Cancel Waiting Message Read Request ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.7.1.17) event with

the following inputs:





iQueue := queueDesc.QueueReference

iTag := dwRequestId



If the Cancel Waiting Message Read Request event returns an error, return a failure HRESULT,
and perform no further actions.

  Remove the PendingRequestEntry (section 3.1.1.2) ADM element instance referenced by the
{phContext, dwRequestId} key pair from the PendingRequestTable (section 3.1.1.3) ADM
element.

  Respond to the pending R_StartReceive or R_StartTransactionalReceive method request with

MQ_ERROR_OPERATION_CANCELLED (0xC00E0008).

##### 3.1.4.9 R_EndReceive (Opnum 9)

The client MUST invoke the R_EndReceive method to advise the server that the message packet
returned by the R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section 3.1.4.7) method has been received.

The combination of the R_StartReceive method and the positive acknowledgment of the
R_EndReceive method ensures that a message packet is not lost in transit from the server to the
client due to a network outage during the call sequence.

hBind: MUST be an RPC binding handle parameter for use by the server=, as specified in [MS-RPCE]

section 2.

phContext: MUST be set by the client to the

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1) handle used in the corresponding call
to the R_StartReceive method. The handle MUST have been returned by the server in the
pphQueue output parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section 3.1.4.2)
method and MUST NOT have been closed through a prior call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum
3) (section 3.1.4.3) method. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

dwAck: MUST be set to an Acknowledgment (ACK) or a Negative Acknowledgment (NACK) for the

message packet received from the server in an R_StartReceive method request. The following
table lists possible values.

Value

Meaning

RR_ACK

The client acknowledges that the message packet was received successfully.

The server MUST remove the message from the queue and make it unavailable for subsequent
consumption.

RR_NACK

The client acknowledges that the message packet was not received successfully.

0x00000001

The server MUST keep the message in the queue and make it available for subsequent
consumption.

dwRequestId: MUST be set by the client to the same value as the dwRequestId parameter in the
corresponding call to the R_StartReceive method. This parameter acts as an identifier to
correlate an R_EndReceive method call to an R_StartReceive method call.

Return Values: On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure HRESULT, and the client MUST treat all failure
HRESULTs identically.

Exceptions Thrown:

instances maintained by the local QueueManager ADM element instance.

If not found, return a failure HRESULT, and perform no further actions; otherwise, assign the
found OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element instance to the local variable queueDesc.

Find the corresponding Message ADM element instance by searching
OpenQueueDescriptor.QueueReference.MessagePositionCollection for a MessagePosition
ADM element instance where MessagePosition.MessageReference.LookupIdentifier equals
the LookupIdentifier ADM attribute of the PendingRequestEntry ADM element instance
referenced by {phContext, dwRequestId}. The corresponding Message ADM element instance is
referred to by the MessageReference ADM attribute of the MessagePosition ADM element
instance where the match was found.



If not found, return MQ_ERROR_MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND (0xC00E0088).

  Set rStatus to the result of a Dequeue Message End ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.7.1.12) event with

the following inputs:







iQueueDesc := queueDesc.

iMessage := The found Message ADM element instance.

iDeleteMessage := True if the dwAck parameter is equal to RR_ACK and false if the dwAck
parameter is equal to RR_NACK.

  Return rStatus.

##### 3.1.4.10 R_MoveMessage (Opnum 10)



The R_MoveMessage method moves a message from one queue to another.<20> The source and
destination queues MUST be related as follows:







The source is a queue, and the destination is a subqueue of the source queue, or

The destination is a queue, and the source is a subqueue of the destination queue, or

The source and destination are two subqueues of the same queue.

 HRESULT R_MoveMessage(
   [in] handle_t hBind,
   [in] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE phContextFrom,
   [in] ULONGLONG ullContextTo,
   [in] ULONGLONG LookupId,
   [in] XACTUOW* pTransactionId
 );

hBind: MUST be an RPC binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.

phContextFrom: MUST be set by the client to a

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1) handle representing the source queue.
The handle MUST have been returned by the server in the pphQueue output parameter of a prior
call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section 3.1.4.2) method with the dwAccess parameter set to
RECEIVE_ACCESS and MUST NOT have been closed through a prior call to the R_CloseQueue

ullContextTo: MUST be set by the client to the value returned by the server in the pMoveContext

output parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum 11) (section 3.1.4.11)
method and MUST NOT have been closed through a prior call to the R_CloseQueue method. This
value MUST NOT be NULL.

LookupId: MUST be set by the client to the lookup identifier of the message to be moved.

pTransactionId: MUST be set by the client as a pointer to a transaction identifier or to a zero value

XACTUOW ([MS-MQMQ] section 2.2.18.1.8) structure. If the destination queue is not a
transactional queue, this value MUST be a pointer to a zero value XACTUOW structure. If the
value of the field is not zero, the transaction identifier MUST have been registered with the server
through a prior call to the R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12) (section 3.1.4.12) method
and MUST NOT be NULL.

Return Values: On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

HRESULTs identically.

Exceptions Thrown:

No exceptions are thrown except those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol, as specified in [MS-
RPCE].

The R_MoveMessage method provides both transactional and non-transactional operations. When
using a transaction identifier, this method provisionally moves a message from the source queue to
the destination queue, pending notification of the transaction outcome. See section 3.1.6. The non-
transactional operation moves a message from the source queue to the destination queue without
enlisting in a transaction.

When processing this call, the server MUST:









Find the corresponding OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element instance for the source queue by
comparing the phContextFrom parameter with the  Handle ADM attribute for all
OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element instances maintained by the local QueueManager ADM
element instance, and then declare and set iSourceQueueDescriptor to the instance.

If not found, return a failure HRESULT.

Find the corresponding OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element instance for the destination queue
by comparing the ullContextTo parameter with the Handle ADM attribute for all
OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element instances maintained by the local QueueManager ADM
element instance, and then declare and set iDestinationQueueDescriptor to that instance.

If not found or if iDestinationQueueDescriptor.AccessType is not
QueueAccessType.MoveAccess, then return MQ_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE (0xC00E0007).

If none of the following conditions is met, return STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER (0xC000000D):







iSourceQueueDescriptor is part of the collection
iDestinationQueueDescriptor.QueueReference.SubqueueCollection.

iDestinationQueueDescriptor is part of the collection
iSourceQueueDescriptor.QueueReference.SubqueueCollection.

iSourceQueueDescriptor.QueueReference.Pathname and
iDestinationQueueDescriptor.QueueReference.Pathname have the same parent queue
pathname. The parent queue pathname MUST be formed by removing the subqueue portion
from the pathname and the preceding ";", as specified in [MS-MQMQ] section 2.1.1.

##### 3.1.4.11 R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum 11)



The R_OpenQueueForMove method opens the queue and returns a
QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.2) handle that can subsequently be used as the
ullContextTo (destination queue) parameter of a call to the R_MoveMessage (Opnum
10) (section 3.1.4.10) method. This method MUST be called before the R_MoveMessage
method.<21>

MUST be one of QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_PUBLIC, QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_PRIVATE,
QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_DIRECT, QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_MACHINE, or
QUEUE_FORMAT_TYPE_SUBQUEUE.

dwAccess: Specifies the required type of access to the queue. MUST be set by the client to

MQ_MOVE_ACCESS (0x00000004).

dwShareMode: Specifies whether the client needs exclusive access to the queue. MUST be set by the

client to MQ_DENY_NONE (0x00000000), which permits multiple
QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE handles to the queue to be opened concurrently.

pClientId: MUST be set by the client to a pointer to a valid GUID that uniquely identifies the client.

When the queue manager acts as the client, the queue manager sets this value to the
Identifier ADM attribute of the local QueueManager ADM element instance. The server SHOULD
ignore this parameter. This value MUST NOT be NULL.

fNonRoutingServer: If the client is configured to operate in the role of an MSMQ routing server,

this parameter MUST be set to FALSE (0x00000000); otherwise, it MUST be set to TRUE
(0x00000001).<22> If the value of the fNonRoutingServer parameter is FALSE (0x00000000), the
server MUST ignore the pClientId parameter.

SHOULD<24> be ignored by the server.

BuildNumber: MUST be set by the client to an implementation-specific Build Number of the client.

SHOULD<25> be ignored by the server.

fWorkgroup: MUST be set to TRUE (0x00000001) by the client if the client machine is not a member

of a Windows domain; otherwise, it MUST be set to FALSE (0x00000000). The RPC
authentication level required by the server MAY be based on this value in subsequent calls on
the interface.<26>

Name  Value

FALSE  0x00000000

TRUE

0x00000001

pMoveContext: The server MUST set this to a random value that can be used as the ullContextTo
parameter in a subsequent call to the R_MoveMessage method. Logically, it represents a
reference to the QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE handle returned in the pphContext
parameter.

pphContext: MUST be set by the server to a QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE handle. A

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE handle opened through a call to this method can be closed
through a subsequent call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section 3.1.4.3) method.

Return Values: The method has no return values. If the method fails, an RPC exception is thrown.

Exceptions Thrown:

In addition to the exceptions thrown by the underlying RPC protocol [MS-RPCE], the method throws
HRESULT failure codes as RPC exceptions. The client MUST treat all thrown HRESULT codes
identically.

The client MUST disregard all out-parameter values when any failure HRESULT is thrown.

When processing this call, the server MUST do the following:



Look up the queue name in the QueueCollection ADM attribute of the local QueueManager ADM
element instance. If not found, throw MQ_ERROR_QUEUE_NOT_FOUND (0xC00E0003).







iFormatName := pQueueFormat

iRequiredAccess := QueueAccessType.MoveAccess

iSharedMode := If dwShareMode is MQ_DENY_NONE then QueueShareMode.DenyNone
else QueueShareMode.DenyReceive.



If rStatus is MQ_OK (0x00000000) then

  Set the pphContext parameter to rOpenQueueDescriptor.Handle.

  Set the pMoveContext parameter to a random value that logically references the handle value

returned in the pphContext parameter.

##### 3.1.4.12 R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12)



The R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction method propagates a distributed atomic transaction context to the
server. The server MUST enlist in the transaction context. The client MUST call this method prior to
the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section 3.1.4.13) method or the R_MoveMessage
(Opnum 10) (section 3.1.4.10) method calls.<27> Subsequent calls to the
R_StartTransactionalReceive method and the R_MoveMessage method that use the same
transaction identifier are coordinated such that either all occur or none occurs, depending on whether
the transaction outcome is Commit or Rollback.

Return Values: On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure HRESULT, and the client MUST treat all failure
HRESULTs identically.

MQ_OK (0x00000000)

Exceptions Thrown:

No exceptions are thrown except those that are thrown by the underlying RPC protocol, as specified in
[MS-RPCE].

While processing this operation, the server MUST:



Enlist into the transaction as specified in [MS-DTCO] section 3.5.4.3.

  Generate a Create Transaction ([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.7.1.8) event with the following inputs:



iTransactionIdentifier := pTransactionId

  Return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

##### 3.1.4.13 R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13)



The R_StartTransactionalReceive method peeks or receives a message from the opened
queue.<29> If a transaction identifier is provided, a message is received inside the specified
transaction.

If the R_StartTransactionalReceive method is invoked with a Peek action type, as specified in the
ulAction parameter, the operation completes when the R_StartTransactionalReceive method
returns.

If the R_StartTransactionalReceive method is invoked with a Receive action type, as specified in
the ulAction parameter, the client MUST pair each call to the R_StartTransactionalReceive method
with a call to the R_EndTransactionalReceive (Opnum 15) (section 3.1.4.15) method to complete the
operation or to the R_CancelReceive (Opnum 8) (section 3.1.4.8) method to cancel the operation. The
call to the R_EndTransactionalReceive method or the R_CancelReceive method is correlated to a
call to the R_StartTransactionalReceive method through matching dwRequestId parameters.

If the client specifies a nonzero ulTimeout parameter and a message is not available in the queue at
the time of the call, the server waits up to the specified time-out for a message to become available in
the queue before responding to the call. The client can call the R_CancelReceive method with a
matching dwRequestId parameter to cancel the pending R_StartTransactionalReceive method
request.

The message to be returned can be specified in one of three ways:



LookupId: A nonzero LookupId parameter value that specifies the unique identifier for the
message to be returned. The ulAction parameter further specifies whether the message to be
returned is the one identified by the LookupId parameter or the first unlocked message
immediately preceding or following it. For more details, see the description of the ulAction
parameter.

  Cursor: A nonzero cursor handle that specifies the cursor to be used to identify the message to

be returned. The cursor specifies a location in the queue. The ulAction parameter further specifies
whether the message to be returned is the one identified by the cursor or the first unlocked
message immediately following it. For more details, see the description of the ulAction parameter.



First: If the LookupId parameter is set to 0x0000000000000000 and hCursor is set to
0x00000000, the first unlocked message in the queue can be returned. For more details, see the
description of the ulAction parameter.

The ppPacketSections parameter is the address of one or more pointers to one or more
SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6) structures. The pSectionBuffer member of the first SectionBuffer
structure points to the beginning of the message packet. If more than one SectionBuffer structure
is present, the packet sections are concatenated in the order in which they appear in the array to form
the entire packet. The size of each section is stored in the SectionSizeAlloc member of the
SectionBuffer structure.

hBind: MUST be an RPC binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.

phContext: MUST be set by the client to a

QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.1) handle of the queue from which to
read a message. The handle MUST have been returned by the server in the pphQueue output
parameter of a prior call to the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section 3.1.4.2) method with the
dwAccess parameter set to RECEIVE_ACCESS and MUST NOT have been closed through a prior
call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section 3.1.4.3) method. NULL is invalid for this parameter.

LookupId: If nonzero, specifies the lookup identifier of the message to be acted on.

If the client sets the LookupId parameter to a nonzero value, the valid values for other parameters
are as follows:







ulTimeout set to 0x00000000

hCursor set to 0x00000000

##### 3.1.4.15 R_EndTransactionalReceive (Opnum 15)



The client MUST invoke the R_EndTransactionalReceive method to advise the server that the
message packet returned by the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section 3.1.4.13)
method has been received by the client.<31>

The combination of the R_StartTransactionalReceive method and the positive acknowledgment of
the R_EndTransactionalReceive method ensures that a message packet is not lost in transit from
the server to the client due to a network outage during the call sequence.

 HRESULT R_EndTransactionalReceive(
   [in] handle_t hBind,
   [in] QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE phContext,
   [in, range(1,2)] DWORD dwAck,
   [in] DWORD dwRequestId
 );

hBind: MUST be an RPC binding handle parameter, as specified in [MS-RPCE] section 2.

phContext: MUST be set by the client to the QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_NOSERIALIZE structure

used in the corresponding call to the R_StartTransactionalReceive method. The handle MUST
have been returned by the server in the pphQueue output parameter of a prior call to the
R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section 3.1.4.2) method and MUST NOT have been closed through a
prior call to the R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section 3.1.4.3) method. This value MUST NOT be
NULL.

dwAck: MUST be set to an Acknowledgment (ACK) or a Negative Acknowledgment (NACK) for the

message packet received from the server in an R_StartTransactionalReceive method request.

Value

Meaning

RR_ACK

The client acknowledges that the message packet was received successfully.

0x00000002

The server MUST NOT remove the packet from the queue. The server removes the packet from
the queue when the transaction is committed.

RR_NACK

The client acknowledges that the message packet was not received successfully.

0x00000001

The server MUST keep the message packet and make it available for subsequent consumption.

dwRequestId: MUST be set by the client to the same value as the dwRequestId  parameter in the
corresponding call to the R_StartTransactionalReceive method. This parameter acts as an
identifier to correlate an R_EndTransactionalReceive method call to an
R_StartTransactionalReceive method call.

Return Values: On success, this method MUST return MQ_OK (0x00000000).

If an error occurs, the server MUST return a failure HRESULT, and the client MUST treat all failure
HRESULTs identically.

Exceptions Thrown:

No exceptions are thrown except those thrown by the underlying RPC protocol, as specified in [MS-
RPCE].

When processing this call, the server MUST do the following:









If the queue referenced by the phContext parameter handle has no
PendingRequestEntry (section 3.1.1.2) ADM element instance in its
PendingRequestTable (section 3.1.1.3) ADM element, return MQ_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE
(0xC00E0007).

Look up the PendingRequestEntry ADM element instance referenced by the {phContext,
dwRequestId} key pair in the PendingRequestTable ADM element. If a match is not found on
the {phContext, dwRequestId} key pair, return MQ_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (0xC00E0006).
Otherwise, remove the PendingRequestEntry ADM element instance from the
PendingRequestTable ADM element, and cancel the associated instance of Pending Request
Cleanup Timer (section 3.1.2.2).

Find the corresponding OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element instance by comparing the
phContext parameter with the Handle ADM attribute for all OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element
instances maintained by the local QueueManager ADM element instance.

If not found, return a failure HRESULT, and perform no further actions; otherwise, assign the
found OpenQueueDescriptor ADM element instance to the local variable queueDesc.

Find the corresponding Message ADM element instance fMessage by searching
queueDesc.QueueReference.MessagePositionCollection for a MessagePosition ADM element
instance fMessagePosition where fMessagePosition.MessageReference.LookupIdentifier equals
the LookupIdentifier ADM attribute of the PendingRequestEntry ADM element instance
referenced by {phContext, dwRequestId}. The corresponding Message ADM element instance
fMessage is referenced by the MessageReference ADM attribute of the matching
MessagePosition ADM element instance fMessagePosition.

## 4 Protocol Examples

The following sections describe several operations that are used in common scenarios in order to
illustrate the function of the Message Queuing (MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol.

### 4.1 Binding to a Server and Purging a Queue

The sequence diagram that follows illustrates a scenario when the client purges a queue. In addition,
it shows how the static RPC endpoint port is acquired by the client to create an RPC binding handle.

1.  The client begins the sequence by creating an RPC binding for the server. Next, the client calls the

R_GetServerPort (Opnum 0) (section 3.1.4.1) method, which returns an RPC endpoint port
number with which the client creates a new binding. The client uses the new binding for all
subsequent calls to the server.

2.  Using the binding from the previous step, the client calls the R_OpenQueue (Opnum

2) (section 3.1.4.2) method, requesting the MQ_RECEIVE_ACCESS (0x00000001) access mode
and a share mode, in addition to client-specific values for the pClientId, fNonRoutingServer, Major,
Minor, BuildNumber, and fWorkgroup parameters. On success, the server returns a new
QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE (section 2.2.4.2) handle.

3.  The client calls the R_PurgeQueue (Opnum 6) (section 3.1.4.6) method. The server confirms that
the queue was opened with the MQ_RECEIVE_ACCESS (0x00000001) access mode and then
removes all messages from the queue.

4.  Finally, the client closes the QUEUE_CONTEXT_HANDLE_SERIALIZE handle with a call to the

R_CloseQueue (Opnum 3) (section 3.1.4.3) method.

Figure 1: The client binds to a server and purges a queue.

### 4.2 Receiving a Message

This sequence diagram illustrates a client receiving a message from a queue at the server. The call
to the R_StartReceive (Opnum 7) (section 3.1.4.7) method includes a ulAction parameter value of
MQ_ACTION_RECEIVE (0x00000000) and a unique dwRequestId parameter value chosen by the
client. In response, the server associates a pending request with the passed dwRequestId parameter,
which is used to correlate a subsequent call to the R_EndReceive (Opnum 9) (section 3.1.4.9) method
or the R_CancelReceive (Opnum 8) (section 3.1.4.8) method with the same value for the dwRequestId
parameter. Additionally, the server returns a SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6) array that contains the
message.

Next, the client indicates that the message was successfully received by calling the R_EndReceive
method, specifying RR_ACK (0x00000002) for the dwAck parameter. The server completes the

<!-- /Extracted images from page 79 -->

corresponding pending request created by the call to the R_StartReceive method and, because
RR_ACK is specified, removes the message from the queue.

Figure 2: The client receives a message.

### 4.3 Receiving a Message in a Transaction

This sequence diagram demonstrates a scenario in which a client receives a message from a queue
within the context of a transaction. Although four roles are used to illustrate the participants in this
scenario, the protocol that is described by this specification is used only between the client and server
roles. The "Client Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC)" role (as specified in [MS-DTCO]) and the
"Server DTC" role are included to illustrate a typical end-to-end sequence of a transactional receive
request.

The diagram includes reference numbers on the left side that identify operations of interest, which are
explained in detail following.

![Extracted image 1 from page 80]([MS-MQRR].images/page080-img01.png)
<!-- /Extracted images from page 80 -->

Figure 3: The client receives a message within a transaction.

1.  The client communicates with the local DTC to create a new transaction, as specified in [MS-

DTCO] section 3.3.4.1.

2.  The client constructs a propagation token to be marshaled to the server's transaction manager, as

specified in [MS-DTCO] section 2.2.5.4.

3.  The client calls the R_QMEnlistRemoteTransaction (Opnum 12) (section 3.1.4.12) method,

specifying the transaction identifier and the transaction propagation token.

4.  The server marshals the transaction propagation token to its local transaction manager and enlists
its local resource manager in the transaction, as specified in [MS-DTCO] sections 3.3.4.12 and
3.5.4.3.

5.  The client calls the R_StartTransactionalReceive (Opnum 13) (section 3.1.4.13) method to receive

a message in the context of the transaction. The client specifies the transaction identifier to

associate the receive operation with the transaction enlisted in the prior steps. The server returns
a message in the SectionBuffer (section 2.2.6) array.

6.  The client advises the server that the message was received correctly by calling the

R_EndTransactionalReceive (Opnum 15) (section 3.1.4.15) method, specifying RR_ACK
(0x00000002) for the dwAck parameter.

7.  The client commits the transaction, as specified in [MS-DTCO] section 3.3.4.8.2. The client DTC

transaction manager notifies the server DTC transaction manager of the commit request.

8.  After receiving notification of the commit from the server DTC via the DTC Transaction Commit

([MS-MQDMPR] section 3.1.4.7) event, the server deletes the message from the queue.

## 5 Security

The following sections specify security considerations for implementers of the Message Queuing
(MSMQ): Queue Manager Remote Read Protocol.

### 5.1 Security Considerations for Implementers

In addition to imposing the minimum RPC authentication level on the RPC handle for incoming
calls, the server might require a different minimum RPC authentication level from the client,
depending on whether the client is a member of a Windows domain, as specified by the fWorkgroup
parameter in the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section 3.1.4.2) and the R_OpenQueueForMove (Opnum
11) (section 3.1.4.11) methods.<38>

software. References to product versions include updates to those products.

The terms "earlier" and "later", when used with a product version, refer to either all preceding
versions or all subsequent versions, respectively. The term "through" refers to the inclusive range of
versions. Applicable Microsoft products are listed chronologically in this section.

Windows Client

  Windows NT Workstation operating system

  Windows 2000 Professional operating system

  Windows XP operating system

  Windows Vista operating system

  Windows 7 operating system

  Windows 8 operating system

  Windows 8.1 operating system

  Windows 10 operating system

  Windows 11 operating system

Windows Server

  Windows NT Server operating system

  Windows 2000 Server operating system

  Windows Server 2003 operating system

  Windows Server 2008 operating system

  Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system

  Windows Server 2012 operating system

  Windows Server 2012 R2 operating system

  Windows Server 2016 operating system

  Windows Server v1709 operating system

  Windows Server 2019 operating system

  Windows Server 2022 operating system

  Windows Server 2025 operating system

Exceptions, if any, are noted in this section. If an update version, service pack or Knowledge Base
(KB) number appears with a product name, the behavior changed in that update. The new behavior
also applies to subsequent updates unless otherwise specified. If a product edition appears with the
product version, behavior is different in that product edition.

Unless otherwise specified, any statement of optional behavior in this specification that is prescribed
using the terms "SHOULD" or "SHOULD NOT" implies product behavior in accordance with the

SHOULD or SHOULD NOT prescription. Unless otherwise specified, the term "MAY" implies that the
product does not follow the prescription.

<1> Section 1.4: If the originating MSMQ application receives messages from a remote queue
through a supporting server, the queue manager on the supporting server uses the protocol
described in [MS-MQQP] but does not support this protocol.

<2> Section 1.7: Windows NT operating system, Windows 2000 operating system, and the Windows
XP operating system do not support this protocol.

<3> Section 1.7: Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2003 and
later server operating systems use Kerberos when the computer is a member of a Windows domain;
otherwise, they use NTLM.

<4> Section 2.1: The Windows Server 2003 protocol client uses RPC dynamic endpoints to obtain
the initial RPC binding handle. The client calls the R_GetServerPort (Opnum 0) (section 3.1.4.1)
method with the initial RPC binding handle and uses the returned value to obtain a new RPC binding
handle to be used for all subsequent RPC method calls on the protocol. When acting as protocol
clients, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2008 and later server
operating systems use RPC dynamic endpoints to obtain the RPC binding handle. This handle is used
for all RPC method calls on the protocol. The R_GetServerPort method is not called by the Windows
Vista and later client operating systems and the Windows Server 2008 and later server operating
systems when acting as protocol clients.

<5> Section 2.2.5.2: The ExtensionHeader (section 2.2.5.2) is not supported on Windows Server
2003.

<6> Section 2.2.5.3: The SubqueueHeader (section 2.2.5.3) is not supported on Windows Server
2003.

<7> Section 2.2.5.4: The DeadLetterHeader (section 2.2.5.4) is not supported on Windows Server
2003.

<8> Section 2.2.5.5: The ExtendedAddressHeader (section 2.2.5.5) is not supported on Windows
Server 2003.

structure values by calling the Windows RPC function UuidCreate.

<10> Section 3.1.2.1: If the registry key
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSMQ\Parameters\RpcCancelTimeout is defined and is set to a nonzero

method with the initial RPC binding handle and uses the returned value to obtain a new RPC binding
handle to be used for all subsequent RPC method calls on the protocol.

When acting as protocol clients, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server
2008 and later server operating systems use RPC dynamic endpoints to obtain the RPC binding
handle. This handle is used for all RPC method calls on the protocol. The R_GetServerPort method is
not called by the Windows Vista and later client operating systems and the Windows Server 2008 and
later server operating systems when acting as protocol clients.

<14> Section 3.1.4.2: Windows Server 2003 protocol servers limit the number of unique concurrent
clients if the following DWORD registry key exists and its value is 0x00000001:
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LicenseInfo\FilePrint. The maximum number of unique
concurrent clients permitted is taken from the DWORD registry key
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LicenseInfo\FilePrint\ConcurrentLimit. If the number of
existing unique callers is equal to this value, the R_OpenQueue (Opnum 2) (section 3.1.4.2) method
throws an RPC exception MQ_ERROR_DEPEND_WKS_LICENSE_OVERFLOW (0xc00e0067).

When acting as protocol servers, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows
Server 2008 and later server operating systems do not enforce limits on the number of unique
concurrent clients. The pClientId parameter is ignored.

<15> Section 3.1.4.2: When acting as protocol clients, Windows Vista and later client operating
systems and Windows Server 2003 and later server operating systems set the fNonRoutingServer
parameter value based on the registry key
HKLM\Software\Windows\MSMQ\Parameters\MachineCache\MQS_Routing.

If this key exists and is set to the DWORD value 0x00000001, the parameter is set to FALSE
(0x00000000); otherwise, it is set to TRUE (0x00000001).

<16> Section 3.1.4.2: When acting as a protocol client, Windows Server 2003 sets the message
queuing Major Version to 5. Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows Server
2008 and later server operating systems protocol clients set the message queuing Major Version to 6.

When acting as protocol servers, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows
Server 2003 and later server operating systems ignore the message queuing Major Version
parameter.

<17> Section 3.1.4.2: The Windows Server 2003 protocol client sets the message queuing Minor
Version to 2.

When acting as protocol clients, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 set the message queuing
Minor Version to 0, while Windows 7 and later client operating systems and Windows Server 2008 R2
and later server operating systems set the message queuing Minor Version to 1.

When acting as protocol servers, the Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows
Server 2003 and later server operating systems ignore the message queuing Minor Version parameter.

<18> Section 3.1.4.2: When acting as protocol clients, Windows Vista and later client operating
systems and Windows Server 2003 and later server operating systems set the message queuing
BuildNumber to a build-specific number.

When acting as protocol servers, Windows Vista and later client operating systems and Windows
Server 2003 and later server operating systems ignore the message queuing BuildNumber parameter.

<19> Section 3.1.4.2: The Windows Server 2003 protocol server minimum RPC authentication level
is determined as follows:

  RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_NONE, if any of the following conditions is true



The fWorkgroup parameter is TRUE.

## 1 Introduction

This specification pertains to the DirectPlay 4 Protocol and describes functionality related to the
reliable delivery of DirectPlay 4 messages. The DirectPlay 4 Protocol guarantees message delivery and
provides throttling for applications that use DirectPlay 4.

Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative. All other sections and examples in
this specification are informative.

### 1.1 Glossary

This document uses the following terms:

acknowledgment (ACK): A signal passed between communicating processes or computers to

signify successful receipt of a transmission as part of a communications protocol.

DirectPlay: A network communication library included with the Microsoft DirectX application

programming interfaces. DirectPlay is a high-level software interface between applications and
communication services that makes it easy to connect games over the Internet, a modem link,
or a network.

DirectPlay 4: A programming library that implements the IDirectPlay4 programming interface.
DirectPlay 4 provides peer-to-peer session-layer services to applications, including session
lifetime management, data management, and media abstraction. DirectPlay 4 first shipped
with the DirectX 6 multimedia toolkit. Later versions continued to ship up to, and including,
DirectX 9. DirectPlay 4 was subsequently deprecated. The DirectPlay 4 DLL continues to ship
in current versions of Windows operating systems, but the development library is no longer
shipping in Microsoft development tools and software development kits (SDKs).

DirectX runtime: A set of libraries created for the family of Windows operating systems that

provide interfaces to ease the development of video games.

DirectX Software Development Kit (DirectX SDK): A set of libraries, called the DirectX

runtime, and supporting infrastructure for building applications for those libraries.

game: An application that uses a DirectPlay protocol to communicate between computers.

game session: The metadata associated with the collection of computers participating in a single

instance of a computer game.

host: In DirectPlay, the computer responsible for responding to DirectPlay game session

enumeration requests and maintaining the master copy of all the player and group lists for the
game. One computer is designated as the host of the DirectPlay game session. All other
participants in the DirectPlay game session are called peers. However, in peer-to-peer mode
the name table entry representing the host of the session is also marked as a peer.

Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX): A protocol that provides connectionless datagram

delivery of messages. See [IPX].

maximum transmission unit (MTU): The size, in bytes, of the largest packet that a given layer

of a communications protocol can pass onward.

payload: The data that is transported to and from the application that is using either the

DirectPlay 4 protocol or DirectPlay 8 protocol.

peer: In DirectPlay, a player within a DirectPlay game session that has an established connection

with every other peer in the game session, and which is not performing game session
management duties. The participant that is managing the game session is called the host.

peer-to-peer: A server-less networking technology that allows several participating network

devices to share resources and communicate directly with each other.

player: A person who is playing a computer game. There can be multiple players on a computer

participating in any given game session. See also name table.

player ID: A 32-bit integer that uniquely represents a player.

round-trip: A process that imports data and then exports that data without data loss.

sequence ID: A monotonically increasing 8-bit identifier for packets. This is typically represented

as a field named bSeq in packet structures.

serial link (or serial transport): Running the DXDiag application over a null modem cable

connecting two computers. See also modem link.

service provider: A module that abstracts details of underlying transports for generic DirectPlay

message transmission. Each DirectPlay message is transmitted by a DirectPlay service
provider. The service providers that shipped with DirectPlay 4 are modem, serial, IPX, and
TCP/IP.

session layer: The fifth layer in the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) architectural model as

defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The session layer is used
for establishing a communication session, implementing security, and performing authentication.
The session layer responds to service requests from the presentation layer and issues service
requests to the transport layer.

throttling: The reduction in the rate of sending data when a network link saturation condition is

detected.

tick count: In DirectPlay, the count from when the system was booted, in milliseconds.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): A protocol used with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send
data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. TCP handles keeping
track of the individual units of data (called packets) that a message is divided into for efficient
routing through the Internet.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP): The connectionless protocol within TCP/IP that corresponds to

the transport layer in the ISO/OSI reference model.

user message: A message that is sent between instances of an application using the DirectPlay

network library as a transport.

MAY, SHOULD, MUST, SHOULD NOT, MUST NOT: These terms (in all caps) are used as defined
in [RFC2119]. All statements of optional behavior use either MAY, SHOULD, or SHOULD NOT.

### 1.2 References

Links to a document in the Microsoft Open Specifications library point to the correct section in the
most recently published version of the referenced document. However, because individual documents
in the library are not updated at the same time, the section numbers in the documents may not
match. You can confirm the correct section numbering by checking the Errata.

#### 1.2.1 Normative References

We conduct frequent surveys of the normative references to assure their continued availability. If you
have any issue with finding a normative reference, please contact dochelp@microsoft.com. We will

### 1.3 Overview

This specification describes the reliable transport mechanism that can be used with the DirectPlay 4
Protocol. This mechanism provides for reliable delivery of messages, message throttling , and for
applications written for the IDirectPlay4 interface. Early implementations of DirectPlay 4 did not
provide reliable delivery and throttling. As a result, in some scenarios, no reliable delivery services
were available. The reliable transport mechanism combines the reliable and unreliable delivery of
messages into a single channel of data. This facilitates a single set of flow control logic that provides
both reliable and unreliable data delivery services, as specified in [USPATENT6438603 B1].

The reliable transport mechanism used by the DirectPlay 4 Protocol is an envelope that encapsulates
all messages sent between connected peers when active. That is, the mechanism becomes active
when the normal DirectPlay 4 connection process has completed. All messages sent to the host during
the connection process do not use the reliable transport mechanism.

The application determines whether the reliable transport mechanism is activated. Use of reliable
transport is exclusive of the use of some of the normally available security functionality in DirectPlay
4. However, when reliable transport is activated, user-level security is not available.

### 1.4 Relationship to Other Protocols

The DirectPlay 4 Protocol is an envelope that wraps both operating system messages and user
messages. This protocol is media-independent because it resides in the session layer of the protocol
stack. DirectPlay typically can be run using service providers for TCP/IP, Internetwork Package
Exchange (IPX), modem, and serial links. From the perspective of service providers, this is an
application-layer protocol. From the perspective of applications, the DirectPlay 4 Protocol is a session-
layer protocol.

The DirectPlay 4 Protocol is transmitted via the TCP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) protocols,
as specified in the DirectPlay 4 Protocol: Core and Service Providers Specification [MC-DPL4CS]. At the
discretion of the game, all of the messages listed in [MC-DPL4CS] can be transmitted via the
DirectPlay 4 Protocol, as described in this specification [MC-DPL4R].

### 1.5 Prerequisites/Preconditions

The DirectPlay 4 Protocol requires the DirectX 6 Runtime.<1>

### 1.6 Applicability Statement

The DirectPlay 4 Protocol is activated only at the request of an application that is written for the
IDirectPlay4 interface and written with the DirectX 6 Software Development Kit or a later version
of the DirectX Software Development Kit (DirectX SDK). All of the functionality present in the
DirectPlay 4 Protocol has been superseded by the DirectPlay 8 Protocol and, as such, the DirectPlay
4 Protocol is only to be used when the game has a requirement to interoperate with other DirectPlay 4
games.

### 1.7 Versioning and Capability Negotiation

There is only one version of the DirectPlay 4 Protocol. It is activated at the request of the application.
It is assumed that the application has taken measures to ensure that the appropriate version of the
DirectX Runtime has been installed on all peers involved in a DirectPlay game session.

If the versions of DirectPlay on all computing systems do not support the DirectPlay 4 Protocol, and
the application has requested that the DirectPlay 4 Protocol be used, the connection process between
peers fails gracefully. That is, a node with a version of the DirectX Runtime earlier than version 5 that
is attempting to join a DirectPlay game session that has the DirectPlay 4 Protocol activated will be
rejected during its join attempt.

For version negotiation between versions of DirectPlay, see [MC-DPL4CS].

### 1.9 Standards Assignments

## 2 Messages

In the DirectPlay 4 Protocol, the terms "frame" and "packet" are used interchangeably. Frames and
packets refer to a single payload that is passed to a lower-layer transport, which is typically
constrained by the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of the network. Messages are higher-
layer payloads that might be fragmented. Messages that do not fit in a single frame can span multiple
frames.

The DirectPlay 4 Protocol supports three types of frames: Data, acknowledgment (ACK), and
NACK.<2> The frame type is determined by the settings for the ACK (ACKNOWLEDGE) and EXT
(EXTENSION) bits of the flags field, and the nNACK bits of the extended flags field in the packet.

Frame type

ACK bit  EXT bit  nNACK bits

Data Frame (section 2.2.2)

Not Set  Not Set  Not present

ACK Frame (section 2.2.4)

Set

Not Set  Not present

NACK Frame (section 2.2.3)  Set

Set

Non-zero

This protocol references commonly used data types as defined in [MS-DTYP].

### 2.1 Transport

Messages are transported over DirectPlay service providers. They can use UDP, IPX, serial, and
modem, or a third-party service provider.

### 2.2 Message Syntax

#### 2.2.1 Frame Format, Player Indexes Header

All DirectPlay 4 Protocol frames begin with source and destination player indexes. A player index
value is the raw index assigned to the player as specified in [MC-DPL4CS] section 3.2.5.4. The index
value is the same as the player ID except that the index does not have the XOR mask applied to
achieve uniqueness, as defined in [MC-DPL4CS] section 3.2.5.4.

Each player index is encoded in a sequence that is one to three bytes in length. The sequence is based
on how many bytes it takes to represent the unsigned 0-0xFFFF ID index value by using 7-bit chunks,
ordered from least to most significant. The most significant bit in each byte indicates whether another
byte follows in the sequence. Depending on the index value, the bytes are populated by using the
following formatting rules:







If the index value is less than 128 (seven bits), the player index is encoded by using a single byte
and the most significant bit is not set. For larger values, the least significant seven bits are stored
in the first byte and the high bit is set to indicate that another byte follows in the sequence.

If the index value is less than 16,384, the second byte contains the most significant seven bits and
the high bit is not set.

If the index value is greater than 16,384, the second byte contains the next most significant seven
bits and the high bit is set to indicate that another byte follows in the sequence.

  When the third byte is present, it contains the most significant bits of the player index, but only
the lowest two bits are set. The high bit MUST NOT be set to indicate additional bytes in the
sequence, and the decoded index value MUST NOT be larger than 0xFFFF.

For example, a player index value of 0x01 is encoded by using a single byte (0x01), and a player
index value of 0xFFFE is encoded by using three bytes (0xFE, 0xFF, 0x03).

IdFrom (variable): The player index of the source encoded by using one to three bytes according to

the formatting rules described in this section.

IdTo (variable): The player index of the destination encoded by using one to three bytes according

to the formatting rules described in this section.

#### 2.2.2 Frame Format, Data Frame

Data frames are messages that deliver user-specified data. The Data frames format specifies message
boundaries and sequencing. Each message is identified by a messageid and each part of the message
is identified by a sequence number. Each unique instance of a piece of a message is uniquely identified
by a serial number. Message serial numbers help statistics-gathering mechanisms to differentiate
between original instances of a message fragment and their retries.

EXT bit is also set, the packet MUST be ignored.

0x10

(STA or START) Indicates the start of a message that can span multiple protocol frames.

0x08

(EOM or END OF MESSAGE) Indicates the end of a message that can span multiple protocol frames.

(ACK or ACKNOWLEDGE) Acknowledges receipt of some frames or the nonreceipt of frames if the
extended flags are present. This bit MUST NOT be set for Data Frame messages.

0x01

(RLY or RELIABLE, ~UNRELIABLE) Indicates the message is reliable if set and unreliable if not set.

messageid (1 byte): A sequentially assigned value, starting at 1. The first message sent MUST be
messageid 1. The second message sent is messageid 2, and so on. There MUST NOT be more
than 24 outstanding messageid(s) on any link.

sequence (1 byte): The sequence number uniquely identifies the packet. It specifies the sequence

space in which ACKs and NACKs are made.

serial (1 byte): For messages that do not span multiple packets and that set both the STA and EOM

flags, the value of the serial field is the count of times this packet has been sent. If the value of
serial is 0, this is the first instance of the packet. If the value of serial is 1, this is the first retry of
this packet. For messages that span multiple packets, the value of serial begins at 0 for the first
instance of the first packet in the message and is incremented for each additional packet in the
message, as well as any retries of any of those packets.

extended flags (1 byte): This field is optional. It is present if the EXT bit is set in the flags

field.<3>

0 (1 bit): MUST be 0.

NACK MASK (variable): A NACK MASK is sent in any message header when packets expected to be
in the message stream are not received. The mask of bits specifies which packets have not been
received by the receiver.

Creation of the mask is based on the sequence number in the NACK packet, which identifies the
first packet that was not received. The bits in the NACK MASK bitmask specify which other
packets relative to that sequence number have also not been received. For example, if the
sequence number is 7 and the NACK MASK is 0x03, then packets with sequence numbers 7, 8,
and 9 have not been received at the receiving end of the link.

## 3 Protocol Details

The DirectPlay 4 Protocol is inherently peer-to-peer. It was also designed to ride on top of existing
connection and game session logic of the existing DirectPlay 4 implementation. Therefore, it needs
no explicit connection logic or game session management logic because that is handled by the
DirectPlay 4 core, as specified in [MC-DPL4CS].

### 3.1 Common Details

#### 3.1.1 Abstract Data Model

First Message: The messageid of the first reliable outstanding message on the outbound link. A

message is outstanding if it has been transmitted but not acknowledged.

Last Message: The messageid of the last reliable outstanding message on the outbound link.

Outstanding Message Mask: A mask of bits that specifies those messages between First Message

and Last Message that have not been acknowledged.

First Unreliable Message: The messageid of the first outstanding message on the outbound link

that is not marked as reliable.

Last Unreliable Message: The messageid of the last outstanding message on the outbound link

that is not marked as reliable.

Unreliable Outstanding Message Mask: A mask of bits that specifies those messages between First

Unreliable Message and Last Unreliable Message that have not been acknowledged.

Unreliable Receive Queue: A queue for assembling parts of unreliable messages before they are

finally assembled and indicated.

Reliable Receive Queue: A queue for assembling reliable messages and maintaining their order for

indication.

First Reliable Receive: The first messageid in the reliable receive queue.

Last Reliable Receive: The last messageid in the reliable receive queue.

Reliable Receive Mask: A mask of bits that indicates which messageids relative to First Reliable

Receive are reliable.

Bytes Received: Count of bytes received on this link.

Average Latency: Average latency of messages sent on this link.

#### 3.1.2 Timers

The DirectPlay 4 Protocol utilizes the computing system specified in [USPATENT6438603 B1] for
estimating available bandwidth and tuning the link appropriately. However, using the scheme
described in the patent is not required to achieve interoperability.

Timers for retries can be set according to the expected delivery time and acknowledge time, plus
some amount of extra time to allow for inconsistencies in link operation.

The current implementation sets the retry time-out to the average round-trip plus three standard
deviations in the average round-trip. A simpler method can also be used, such as the average round-
trip plus an extra percentage, such as 20%. When no messages have previously been sent, the initial
starting value can be set to 1 second.

DirectPlay 4 Protocol: Reliable
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


#### 3.1.3 Initialization

All sequence numbers MUST start at 1. All serial numbers MUST start at 0.

The count of bytes received SHOULD correspond as closely as possible to the total bytes received from
the sender on the receiver's link, and SHOULD include the duplicate (retransmitted) packets.

The tick count is a 32-bit value counting 1/1000ths of a second of elapsed time. It can start at any
value but MUST increase at the specified rate.

NACKs are not triggered, but only occur when missing frames are detected.

Note  However, an implementation can attempt to trigger NACKs using a timer-based algorithm
approach.

ACKs are triggered by either the SAK bit in the message header or by the end of the message.

ACKs MAY wait for a timer before sending, unless the SAK bit has been specified by the sender.

#### 3.1.4 Higher-Layer Triggered Events

None.

#### 3.1.5 Processing Events and Sequencing Rules

##### 3.1.5.1 Player Indexes Header Processing

When any frame arrives, the player indexes header specified in section 2.2.1 MUST be evaluated to
ensure that the source and destination player indexes represent valid players participating in the
game session, as specified in [MC-DPL4CS]. When delivering data frame payloads to the higher
layer, these indexes SHOULD be provided.

##### 3.1.5.2 Data Frame Processing

When a Data frame (section 2.2.2) arrives, the value of its messageid field MUST be compared to the
list of receiving messages using 8-bit unsigned integer math, and according to the following rules:

Note  When processing Data frames, the receiver MUST keep track of the last messageid that was
received reliably.







If there are no ongoing receives or completed receives, then this messageid MUST become the
first ongoing receive.

If the value of the messageid field is outside the range of the messageid of the earliest ongoing
or completed receive (and that messageid+23), the Data frame MUST be ignored.

If no message with the messageid value is currently being received, the messageid of this
message MUST be added to the list of receiving messages.

The only exception to this rule is when a reliable Data frame is received and the value of its
messageid is the same as the last reliable message received. In this case, an acknowledgment
(ACK) message MUST be sent back to the sender. This exception handles the situation where an ACK
that was sent for a previously received message was lost. Because a message that was previously
received is now being received again, it is possible that the ACK that was previously sent was lost and
needs to be retransmitted.

When the messageid of a message is initially added to the list of receiving messages, a new message
buffer MAY be allocated for the message. This buffer is used for assembling the message according to

16 / 25

[MC-DPL4R] - v20240423
DirectPlay 4 Protocol: Reliable
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


the sequence numbers associated with the messageid as necessary. When all of the following Data
frames have been received, the Data (variable) areas of those messages are concatenated in
sequence order to make up the receive data for that message:

  A Data frame with a particular messageid, a starting sequence, and a STA bit set.

  A Data frame with the same messageid, an ending sequence, and an EOM set.

  All Data frames with the same messageid in the contiguous intervening sequence space.

Note  Using 8-bit unsigned integer math, if a message is not received reliably and not all parts of the
message have been received, and the currently receiving messageid is equal to the messageid+24
of this unreliable message, then the unreliable message SHOULD be discarded.

During assembly of the receive data, a NACK or ACK MUST be sent in the following circumstances:





If the sequence number is not the current expected sequence number, a NACK packet MUST be
sent back to the sender. It is at the discretion of the implementation to send the NACK
immediately or to wait for more time or more receive data before sending the NACK.<7> Delaying
the NACK might result in efficiency gains.

If the Data frame has its SAK bit set, an ACK or NACK MUST be sent back to the sender without
waiting for more time to elapse or more data to be received.<8>

  When the final part in a multipart message is received, an ACK MUST be sent back to the sender

without waiting for more time to elapse or more data to be received.

After the receive data is fully assembled, the data is indicated to the higher layers, and the
messageid of the message MUST be removed from the list of receiving messages.

##### 3.1.5.3 ACK and NACK Processing

When an ACK frame (section 2.2.4) arrives, the data associated with the messageid in the
acknowledgment (ACK) message and any earlier messageids MAY be discarded.

When a NACK frame (section 2.2.3) arrives, the data associated with the messageid-1 in the NACK
frame (section 2.2.3) MAY be discarded. Any other data is indicated as received, but the presence of a
0 bit in the NACK mask can also be discarded. Any other data MUST be retransmitted.

##### 3.1.5.4 Bytes Received Processing

Any time that data arrives from a remote sender, the size of the entire Data Frame (section 2.2.2),
not including the player indexes header (section 2.2.1), is accumulated in a per-link value called bytes
received. This value is included in any acknowledgment (ACK) or NACK message on that link.

#### 3.1.6 Timer Events

Timers are recommended as specified in [USPATENT6438603 B1]. However, this scheme is not
required to achieve interoperability.

#### 3.1.7 Other Local Events

None.

## 4 Protocol Examples

### 4.1 One-Way Traffic Between Node A and Node B

In the following examples, one-way traffic between Node A and Node B is covered. Node A sends four
messages to Node B:

  Message 1: Three Data frames (section 2.2.2) in length, marked as reliable.

  Message 2: One Data frame in length, not marked as reliable.

  Message 3: One Data frame in length, marked as reliable, will drop in first transmission.

  Message 4: Two Data frames in length, not marked as reliable.

#### 4.1.1 Message 1

Node A sends Message 1 to the receiver, Node B. This message is three Data frames (section 2.2.2) in
length and is marked as reliable.

 Message 1:  DATA FRAME: 1
 Flags:      STA, RLY messageid: 0, sequence: 0, serial: 0
 Message 1:  DATA FRAME: 2
 Flags:      RLY messageid: 0, sequence: 1, serial: 1
 Message 1:  DATA FRAME: 3
 Flags:      EOM, RLY messageid: 0, sequence: 2, serial: 2

All three Data frames arrive on the receiver, Node B, and the receiver indicates this to the higher
layers.

The receiver sends back an ACK frame to the sender, Node A.

 Flags:      ACK messageid: 0, sequence: 2, bytes received: 4500

#### 4.1.2 Message 2

Node A sends Message 2 to the receiver, Node B. This message is one Data frame (section 2.2.2) in
length and is not marked as reliable.

 Message 2:  DATA FRAME
 Flags:      STA, EOM messageid: 1, sequence: 3, serial: 0

It is possible that there can be an ACK by the receiver for a frame that is not marked as reliable; this
is at the discretion of the implementation. However, sending an ACK allows the sender, Node A, to
manage resources more efficiently.

#### 4.1.3 Message 3

Node A sends Message 3 to the receiver, Node B. This message is one Data frame (section 2.2.2) in
length, is marked as reliable, and will drop the first transmission.

 Message 3:  DATA FRAME
 Flags:      STA, EOM, RLY messageid: 2, sequence: 4, serial:0

18 / 25

[MC-DPL4R] - v20240423
DirectPlay 4 Protocol: Reliable
Copyright © 2024 Microsoft Corporation
Release: April 23, 2024


If Message 3 is dropped, but the sender, Node A, still sends Message 4 (section 4.1.4) to the receiver,
Node B, this would result in the following.

 Message 4:  DATA FRAME: 1
 Flags:      STA messageid: 3, sequence: 5, serial: 0
 Message 4:  DATA FRAME: 2
 Flags:      EOM messageid: 3, sequence: 6, serial: 1

This can trigger a NACK on the receiver, Node B.

The receiver, Node B, sends back a NACK to the sender, Node A.

 Flags:      NACK messageid: 2, sequence: 4,
             nNACK: 0, no NACK mask present, bytes received 8954

In response to the NACK, the sender, Node A, attempts a retransmission of Message 3 to Node B.

 Message 3:  DATA FRAME (retry)
 Flags:      STA, EOM, RLY messageid: 2, sequence: 4, serial: 1

#### 4.1.4 Message 4

The sender, Node A, sends Message 4 to the receiver, Node B. This message is two Data
frames (section 2.2.2) in length and is not marked as reliable.

 Message 4:  DATA FRAME: 1
 Flags:      STA messageid: 3, sequence: 5, serial: 0
 Message 4:  DATA FRAME: 2
 Flags:      EOM messageid: 3, sequence: 6, serial: 0

This can trigger a NACK on the receiver. For more information, see section 4.1.3.
